1,"solo trip to maldives nov- dec. 2021 - advice please!hello all! 

i am traveling by myself to maldives nov. 23- dec. 11 2021. i am planning but haven't confirmed, to do a liveaboard first then go stay on land somewhere. i understand the diving is broken. up into five regions and i'd love to do the deep south atolls, but maybe that isn't possible during the time i am there via liveaboard. in that case i'd try to stay at a resort after a liveaboard (or before) and do the south and/or any part of the deep south if possible. 

i am open water advanced and nitrox certified and trying to figure out which liveaboard to do, current considerations include; adora, or azeala...but i just started researching. i love rays and sharks and it seems those are both seen fairly regularly in the maldives.  i just want to make the most of my trip, and while i don't have unlimited resources, i will be saving up and know it's a more expensive trip overall. i have my plane ticket, but can change the date if need be, so if a week or two in either direction makes a difference, i am lucky i can make that adjustment. 

i'd rather avoid the heavy tourist/crowd times if i can, which seem to start towards the end of dec., but i do realize the weather and visibility get better. a little rain doesn't both me, but consistently rough seas are something i'd like to avoid on a live aboard. 

any advice on regions to dive, liveaboards and resorts in a region i will not hit via liveaboard are welcome.

while research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how participants perceive the associated risks in others activities/sports and, more generally, how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. to this end i have designed a survey and i would like yo enlist your kind help.

the survey data will be used by students to design adventure outdoor recreation programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and i will to use the data to write several research overviews.  the background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html)

warning: my wife says i'm overthinking this, and i'm sure she's right. this question asks about the physics of buoyancy and air pressure, or something like that.

so, for example: on the surface (1 atm), my tank holds 80 cu. ft. of air at 3,000 psi. the tank is a single-walled device. pressure is evenly distributed throughout the tank. correct?

assuming it is correct, as i descend the air in the tank compresses. at 2 atm, the air is compressed to 1/2 of the original volume. the tank integrity is intact, meaning the tank itself is not squeezing or compressing, even though the water pressure around it has increased. so, why does the air inside the tank compress?",gotta understand someth start one peopl understand everyth case need fulli understand buoyanc open water cours end month would rather irrit guy take time class make instructor explain warn wife say overthink sure right question ask physic buoyanc air pressur someth like exampl surfac atm tank hold cu ft air psi tank singl wall devic pressur evenli distribut throughout tank correct assum correct descend air tank compress atm air compress origin volum tank integr intact mean tank squeez compress even though water pressur around increas air insid tank compress

however, i was really interested in the garmin descent mk2i, but the price was a bit harder for me to swallow. i also play golf occasionally, spin, and run so i thought the mk2 could be more useful but not sure i can justify the price difference. i additionally thought that maybe i would get a second transmitter to monitor my wife's air as well just for ease of not having to turn and ask.

1,"reflections on a return to florida's cave countryit's a mild evening in the low 70s as i cruise north along us-27 east of branford. past troy springs, blown out from seasonal flooding of the suwannee river. conditions that have reshaped my schedule for the week.

i'm heading to a country style dinner at momma t's in mayo and from there to sleep at my hammock in the back lot of dive outpost. i'm tired. i've spent the entire day at blue grotto on cave line exercises and simulated dive planning &amp; decompression. preparing for deeper dives on trimix later in the week at chassahowitzka wildlife management area north of tampa. 

i spent the first days of my trip at ginnie springs. going over buoyancy, trim, the four major propulsion kicks, mask/regulator/light switches, and much loathed valve shutdowns. over and over again until confident i could do them easily in a stress overload situation with multiple things going wrong. 

two decades ago, i completed an iantd technical cave certification over 18 months at peacock springs and 40 fathom grotto after multiple trips down to northern florida from my home state of michigan. i haven't been on a legit cave dive in 15 years. the roommate i got cave certified with moved to oregon to follow a woman and chase dreams of being a fly fishing guide. i got into a serious relationship that progressed to marriage. my career became a lot busier. my outdoor interests detoured to ultralight wilderness backpacking. then factors related to the covid-19 epidemic led me back to frequent diving beyond the annual tropical saltwater trip and summer great lakes wreck charters.

the reason for the 19 hour drive down here from grand rapids is to determine whether i want to spend the time and money for a multi-day cave refresher course. i've decided that's what's responsible before i return to any typical cave penetration dives. when i was certified in my 20s, the allure of cave diving was the challenge, the gear, the status. those young guy reasons are well behind me now. if i'm going back into underwater caves today, it needs to be for a serious interest in the caves themselves. also possibly cave photography in the style of sj alice bennett. a christmas 2020 trip to tulum that included dives at angelita, el pit, bat cave, and nic te ha has been my inspiration. 

driving along, i pass numerous trump signs still up months after the election. northern florida is a unique place. it's the rural, small town deep south rather than the genteel south of the carolinas &amp; savannah, the hillbilly south of appalachia, the urban south of atlanta, or the creole south of new orleans &amp; the mississippi river delta. i like it here. the people are friendly. it's relaxed -unlike much of the rest of florida which has just 2/3 the area of michigan but double the population and the crazies.

my mind wanders back to scuba. beyond the decision i need to make about cave diving, there's also the issue of sidemount. i still dive backmount. after having taken a sdi sidemount workshop last year, i'm convinced it's the wave of the future. not only for open water technical diving but also for recreational divers. the benefits for me are the added safety factor for solo diving and being kinder to the aging body. valve shutdowns are also hella easier.

then there's freediving. while florida's spring diving culture hasn't changed much in 20 years, there are two newer participants -the freedivers and their monofin mermaid cousins. freediving isn't a sport i thought i'd have much interest in. after speaking with a few of them and listening to their passion, i'm intrigued. like a seal, they're gracefully sexy in the water in a way that nerdy gear laden scuba divers aren't. freediving also has carry over benefits to scuba. 

fast forward a week later. twenty dives newly logged to my subsurface account. i didn't make it to old favorites like peacock &amp; royal because of the flooding. i skipped jackson blue, morrison, and vortex in the panhandle due to a three day detour to my parents' in bonita springs. but i was able to discover beautiful caverns at alexander and ichetuknee for the first time, shook fins with the manatees at hunter springs on the crystal river, and got to the bottom of buford without narcosis. i've come to the conclusion there's an xdeep stealth 2.0 in my near future. still uncertain about the free diving. 

as for doing a cave refresher in florida... as much as i love the culture and cave diving history of the suwannee valley and the beautiful blue-green glow of its springs, it's a lot faster and probably less expensive to fly to cancún, rent tanks and hire an instructor from under the jungle or protec than it is for me to drive 2,200 miles round trip on i-75. quintana roo's caves are generally more speleothemic scenic. tulum has street tacos 5/$2. i can hang my hammock on the caribbean. if i decide to brave the monsters of the deep rather than the ghosts of the maya, it's quick hop over to cozumel.

i've been working as a padi dm for about 3 years now and been diving for 5, my plan is to go to melbourne, study during the week and work during the weekends as a dm on some center (not a dive boat)

my main question and worry is this:

how feasible and productive is this idea?

my worry is that i've heard diving in first world countries is more complicated since dms can only do dsds under certain and very restrained conditions and they mostly are kept for surface support and maybe dlds aka only instructors make some decent money 

in third world countries padi doesn't really care that much so there is much more freedom, as a dm i've done practically every single activity i'm capable of and with a much, much more difficult and colder sea. obviously always with the approval and trust of an instructor but not as restrained by him being ""on the water""

lastly, do you make any money at all? is it enough to make a humble living?

i think that is about all of the doubts i have

i'm lucky enough to be in a position where i might very well be able to ask for 4 weeks off in a row. we get 3 weeks already, and i might be able to do something like save up a little bit past a full calendar year and take advantage of an extra week stacking on top of the 3 from before. 

we'll see. 

so i want to plan this out ahead of time. please rep your favorite place here and what it has to offer in terms of diving. 

also, i will not be able to go to more than 2 of these places at once...honestly, i don't like bouncing around too much, and the flight costs will add up. not to mention the time cost of having to pack and unpack on traveling days, etc. 

i will also not be able to do liveaboards. visiting with my mom who is not a diver and is a very 'relaxed' personality who enjoys just simply relaxing. 

i have my ow, aow, deep diving, aquatic life id (whatever is the one where you just learn what fish to look for), buoyancy, underwater navigation, and maybe 3 other dives under my belt. 

i was certified in puerto rico in late 2018. that was where i got all those certs and the first and last time i dived. 

i've been a lifelong competitive swimmer. grew up with it so being in the water isn't hard for me. 

other than the **obvious** major bucket list items if you loved your visit i'd definitely like to know why. i need to make this trip really worthwhile b/c i prefer taking long vacations instead of quick short trips every 2 months or so. so it's going to be quite some time before i get a chance to go diving anywhere cool for a while. 

here's what i know so far:

belize = great blue hole and 2nd largest barrier reef

cozumel = extension of belize barrier reef, cenotes not too far away

cayman = wall diving

hawaii = manta rays and stuff. 

also my budget for this trip will be (let's just say a tentative) $2,000 a week...total. i already understand that hawaii will likely be the one that pushes most against this limit, but like i said...i've got a longggggg time before i go diving anywhere near as fantastic as places like this. so if i have to yolo my finances a bit then i'm willing to go a little extra.

1,"suba diving has been a dream of mine since i was a child. what would be the cheapest way i can achieve this dream?ever since i was a child, i have been in love with the idea of scuba diving. it seems like it would be like entering a dream and is the only thing on my bucket list. it's the only thing i would regret not doing if i died tomorrow. 

i am on disability (my disability would not affect my ability to dive) so there's not a lot i can do with $13,000 a year. that said, i can put a little away here and there and maybe i can do this in a few years.

when i say cheapest i'm talking all expenses. from travel costs,  hotel prices, rental equipment, and food. i would imagine diving in the bahamas would be more expensive than taking a bus to florida. i know nothing about diving and am using these places as an example because a bus ride to a place like florida coupled with their hotel and restaurant prices would probably be cheaper than flying to the bahamas and paying tourist prices for everything. 

that said, this is a literal dream of mine so i'd rather pay $5000 to dive in a beautiful underwater world vs $1200 to snorkel in dirty boring florida water (again this is all hypothetical).

1,"can aquatic animals get air embolisms from sudden pressure changes?i've learned recently that when fishermen haul their catch up out of the sea, they (the fish) are often suffering from the bends and are therefore in a lot of pain. i always thought that the bends were caused by the nitrogen that's present at high concentrations in scuba tanks boiling out of solution in the blood, which led me to believe that it only happens to air-breathing creatures who are using artificial means to breathe underwater. is that not correct?

if you were to drag a fish or other aquatic animal to the surface rapidly, is there a chance they might develop a fatal embolism, or is that a scientific certainty? or was i right in the first place, and water-breathing creatures are immune to air embolisms? please help, i'm terribly confused. 😵",aquat anim get air embol sudden pressur chang learn recent fishermen haul catch sea fish often suffer bend therefor lot pain alway thought bend caus nitrogen present high concentr tank boil solut blood led believ happen air breath creatur use artifici mean breath underwat correct drag fish aquat anim surfac rapidli chanc might develop fatal embol scientif certainti right first place water breath creatur immun air embol pleas help terribl confus

1,"dan insurance for non-diveri'm an experienced diver and currently have the dive accident guardian plan.

my bf is not a diver, but we will be going on a dive-centric trip out of country in mid-april. he will likely be snorkeling. he might also try a discover scuba session if he's feeling comfortable.

* *i'm unsure if he should have dive accident insurance...or if maybe just trip insurance would cover him if he were to get hurt.*

i also notice that ""named water sports"" are not covered within 50 miles of home? i live in florida, so that seems pointless and a high chance he/i could be within 50 miles of home. we both like to fish (and deep sea fish), and it sounds like this isn't covered either through named water sports (regardless of being 50 miles away or not).

i will call dan directly to get clear answers on these concerns before getting him coverage (if any), but just thought i'd post here too if anyone is super familiar with the coverage/exclusions.

the [handbook](https://media.dan.org/cms/dan-nufic-guardian-handbook-fl.pdf) (florida) doesn't even mention jet skis but does specifically call out that parasailing is not covered. i guess i need them to clarify that. 

it really leaves things in question when even the handbook doesn't fully explain everything.

1,"help: wide face, leaky maskhey folks, hoping to get some advice from the community on this.

tl;dr
i have a wide face and eye “dimples” which cause a mask to leak and can’t seem to find the right fit

backstory: about 4 years ago, i went on a snorkeling trip with a tour company in grand turk. long story short, i spent about 10 minutes total in the water because the tour provided mask was terribly leaky and i was having a real issue with salt water in my eyes.

fast forward to today: i’ve got another snorkeling trip booked for next month in key west and i decided to be proactive in buying my own mask for this trip. i went into a local dive shop and after testing some masks, ended up going with a tusa freedom hd at the advice of the shop’s owner. he let me know this was really my best bet because i have a pretty large head and face to go along with it and that one did the best job at covering enough of my face.

took the mask home and decided to test it out and lo and behold, i’m still having the exact same issue as i did all those years ago. through some trial and error, i’ve pinpointed the leaking issue to the corners of my eyes on both sides of my head. it seems like i have something like an eye “dimple” and the mask isn’t getting a proper seal around it. 

with some testing and adjusting the mask (loosening it since apparently that’s a thing), i’ve got it down to a minimal amount of water coming in if i can get the mask to go on just right.

what i’m worried about is that when i get to florida and i’m out in the open water, it’s going to be incredibly difficult to get the mask fit just right, especially if i have to expel some water out of the mask (dive shop owner told me to look up and blow out, which is super helpful). 

so what i’m wondering is if you guys have any suggestions on how to mitigate this issue. should i look into a different style of mask or a different brand? should i tape the skirt with some athletic tape to hold it down where the “dimples” are? would a full face mask snorkel be a better option?

i’m open to all of your ideas, unfortunately, everything on the internet just says shave your face and get a good fitting mask, so that’s why i’ve come to the experts!

thanks in advance!

edit:
i ended up purchasing a seac libera full face mask just to give it a shot and it works with a great seal! thanks for everyone’s input! if i end up pursuing getting scuba certified, which is something i’ve always wanted to do, i’ll definitely be looking into some of these other mask suggestions!",help wide face leaki maskhey folk hope get advic commun tl dr wide face eye dimpl caus mask leak seem find right fit backstori year ago went snorkel trip tour compani grand turk long stori short spent minut total water tour provid mask terribl leaki real issu salt water eye fast forward today got anoth snorkel trip book next month key west decid proactiv buy mask trip went local shop test mask end go tusa freedom hd advic shop owner let know realli best bet pretti larg head face go along one best job cover enough face took mask home decid test lo behold still exact issu year ago trial error pinpoint leak issu corner eye side head seem like someth like eye dimpl mask get proper seal around test adjust mask loosen sinc appar thing got minim amount water come get mask go right worri get florida open water go incred difficult get mask fit right especi expel water mask shop owner told look blow super help wonder guy suggest mitig issu look differ style mask differ brand tape skirt athlet tape hold dimpl would full face mask snorkel better option open idea unfortun everyth internet say shave face get good fit mask come expert thank advanc edit end purchas seac libera full face mask give shot work great seal thank everyon input end pursu get certifi someth alway want definit look mask suggest

1,"padi expels thai scuba instructor after horrific glass attack on uk tourist!koh tao, thailand: following an inquiry lasting from late september 2020 to early december 2020, the professional association of diving instructors aka padi expelled a violent thai diving instructor. 

on saturday, 15 august 2020 the instructor, pat khokpool aka santi khokpool slashed open the left side of a tourist’s neck in the busy fishbowl beach bar on sairee beach, koh tao in an unprovoked attack. 

immediately prior the attack, santi had been assaulting a female tourist when the 28-year-old scottish tourist walked over and asked whether everything was ok whereupon khokpool instantly turned around smashing a beer bottle on the scotsman’s jaw then proceeded to slash open the victim’s neck with the broken bottle.

only excellent first aid and emergency surgery on the nearby island of koh samui prevented the attack from becoming yet another murder on koh tao, which has earned the tag “death island.”

shortly after the attack, khokpool was fired by ban’s diving resort, the largest scuba diving school on the island.  the fishbowl beach bar is part of the ban’s business.

it appears that the royal thai police have taken no action against khokpool who is a friend of the local police sergeant major “chet.”  khokpool has other powerful connections such as an older brother, saravut khokpool who is a police lieutenant colonel.

personally, i felt like 6 lbs was pushing it a little as the tank got lighter, but i was doing pretty well at managing my buoyancy with breath control. i think 8 lbs would have been comfortable. i'm not sure i would've felt okay with 4 towards the end of a dive.

10 lbs felt over weighted frequently, and i kept having to mess with air in the bcd or my feet would drag. 

so, i'm very confused now and have no idea what weight i should use. maybe i'm overthinking this and should just do 8-10 lbs, because i can always dump weight if i gotta, right?

in short : we are needing two bc/reg/computer set ups for warm florida diving (both ocean and spring), no plans for cold water diving, one set up for a smaller female. since we're buying two set ups, we are trying for more cost conscious options too. and i will be trying to support our local dives shops as much as we can, i've just felt very overwhelmed when going in, and feeling like they are just trying to sell us the most expensive options! i also feel like we get different recommendations in different stores, depending on what they carry. i've like to know what i want ahead of time, then go buy in store.

1,"having trouble with the mask removal skill (beginner diver)sorry for bad english, not my native language.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm trying for the first time to get my padi open water diver certificate. today i had those classes in the swimming pool. i found the exercises harder harder than i'd thought, but everything went fine and i could complete all the exercises in the first or second try, except for the last one, in which i had to take off my mask under water, breathe without the mask, put it back on, and clear the water out of it.

&amp;#x200b;

it wasn't easy for me to breathe without the mask using only my mouth, without letting water go up my nose. actually, and funnily, i can do it quite easily when i'm floating on the surface with my face down into the water, but, when i have to do it while kneeling on the bottom of the pool, i can only do it for like 10 seconds without getting water up my nose and kind of drowning. it's especially hard for me when i have to clear the water out of the mask, that's when it's most likely for me to get water up my nose and become desperate with the feeling that i'm drowning.

&amp;#x200b;

i tried this exercise several times, like ten times, and the instructor was getting kind of impatient (even though he tried not to show it) and i was getting more and more anxious and even kind of sad for not being able to complete the exercise. in the end, i almost made it and the instructor pretended that i had made it, even though i almost drowned.

&amp;#x200b;

now i'm a bit worried, especially about the scenario in which i lose my mask under water. is it common to have so much trouble doing this exercise? do you guys have any advice?

- would i be able to practice in a chlorine pool to build confidence/muscle memory?

first of all, i’m not planning on trying any of this so don’t worry. i’m just curious :)

i’ve seen some interesting research coming out of israel on the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. for those interested, i’ve shared a link below.

what i’m trying to figure out is whether diving with 100% oxygen at 2 ata would be the same thing? 

here’s a snippet from the paper detailing the treatment:

“our protocol included 60 sessions of 100% oxygen at 2 ata including 3 air breaks during each session in order to utilize the hyperoxic hypoxic paradox and minimize the risk for oxygen toxicity.”

if it is the same thing, then surely scuba diving could be an alternative? it would be really interesting to know your thoughts.

now several days later the rash is nearly gone and the swelling is down substantially but is still present in a pocket just beneath my sternum. my abdomen is very tender still. 

the dove that did it was not my longest or deepest dive and my gradient factors were the same as they have always been. the best i can tell, i was slightly dehydrated and went straight to bed. i think had i drank a bunch of water after the dive i would have been fine. i was also unable to get comfy during deco because the cave at 20’ was a tight passage with gnarly flow so i was pretty tense trying to hold position. not great for off-gassing.

with that out of the way - i am a fairly new ow diver &lt;10 dives after cert, and i was wondering about how strict is the 18 meters open water limit?  
obviously, if it was a blue water dive, with +/- \~5% guage inaccuracy, you would want to stay somewhat away from 18 meters, lest you find yourself at 26 meters without warning.

however, say i am diving on a reef that goes from \~18 meters to \~20 meters depth and i want to get closer to a particular organism/formation that happens to be sitting at 20 meters, would the dm running the dive be annoyed if i swam slightly deeper? would it be irresponsible?

i did my padi ow a few years back, have about 35 dives under my belt, i figure now's a good time to get my advanced (i'm actually glad i didn't do the 'advanced immediately after open' thing that so many shops push....). 

looking around at local courses, there's padi ow, typically for about $500-$550 (aud), so i know how that looks - 3 shores dives, 2 boat dives, including mandatory nav/deep and 3 electives, usually peak performance buoyancy and 2 others

i noticed raid advanced 35, which seems to have 6 dives plus a pool session - although it's up to $750-800

so - yes, i know people could argue the relative benefits of different agencies until the cows come home so this is probably a risky question - but is the additional raid time worth the difference?  it looks like a more comprehensive course - is it worth doing this over padi?  it is significantly more expensive, but if it's justifiable then i can do that.  if it leaves me with more solid training and skills than the padi would, then that can only help me.  if it helps, i'm not entirely convinced that my ow provider was very good :p",advanc padi raid hi thread search find anyth though sure ask might wrong sub padi ow year back belt figur good time get advanc actual glad advanc immedi open thing mani shop push look around local cours padi ow typic aud know look shore boat includ mandatori nav deep elect usual peak perform buoyanc notic raid advanc seem plu pool session although ye know peopl could argu rel benefit differ agenc cow come home probabl riski question addit raid time worth differ look like comprehens cours worth padi significantli expens justifi leav solid train skill padi would help help entir convinc ow provid good p

i’m itching to dive and my partner is still leery of travel due to covid. i’m cautious but willing to take the risk and i *should* be vaccinated by the time the trip happens (fingers crossed)... anyway i digress. 

i calculated the cost of the trip, and i believe it would be cheaper by a couple hundred dollars if i were to take this trip alone (not with the group). 

so if i’m paying a premium to travel with the group, is it worth it? i’d love to read your experiences with group travel, either solo or as a pair, etc. is there enough value-added to a group travel trip to make it worth a premium price? would you do it again?

1,"please help us decide between the following 3 regulatorsmy wife and i are at around 80 dives over the last 7-8 years. we’ve started doing more regular local diving in san diego, and it’s time for us to get our own regs. we plan to do the gue fundamentals course in the next few months. 

i know with proper care and maintenance, regulators can last 20-30 years, so i’m willing to go in at the higher price point knowing that it’s something we are going to use for a long time. we plan to do a lot of southern california diving, and we generally try to do at least one longer yearly trip to somewhere tropical like hawaii, tahiti, quintana roo, or indonesia. we are interested in diving somewhere colder like iceland, canada, or alaska, but any diving like that would just be one-off trips. we don’t really plan on going the tech route right now, but that wouldn’t be completely out of the question either. 

after doing my own initial research it seems like the following three regulators are available and serviceable to me locally. and these are the ones that caught my eye the most because of their quality and features. 

- apeks mtx-rc
- scubapro mk25 evo + (s620ti, s600, or g260)
- hollis dcx + 200lx

i really like the swivel turret and number of ports on all of them, and the specs are all fairly comparable. the main difference seems to be piston (scubapro) vs diaphragm (apeks and hollis). i’ve been told piston has less moving parts so it should generally last longer and be more durable, and diaphragms are more rugged to withstand extreme environments. i have no idea what the different service costs would be. 

does anyone have a strong case for any of these 3 regulators that make the most sense for our situation if money isn’t a big factor?",pleas help us decid follow regulatorsmi wife around last year start regular local san diego time us get reg plan gue fundament cours next month know proper care mainten regul last year go higher price point know someth go use long time plan lot southern california gener tri least one longer yearli trip somewher tropic like hawaii tahiti quintana roo indonesia interest somewher colder like iceland canada alaska like would one trip realli plan go tech rout right complet question either initi research seem like follow three regul avail servic local one caught eye qualiti featur apek mtx rc scubapro mk evo ti g holli dcx lx realli like swivel turret number port spec fairli compar main differ seem piston scubapro vs diaphragm apek holli told piston less move part gener last longer durabl diaphragm rug withstand extrem environ idea differ servic cost would anyon strong case regul make sens situat money big factor

1,"advice on fine-tuning weights, trim to help buoyancyhi everyone, i posted a little while ago about some frustration with my open water course and my dry suit. i’m happy to report i was able to finish the course and get certified! i’m feeling confident, except for buoyancy. i know that’s something every new diver just has to learn, but i wanted some tips on weight and trim. 

the biggest buoyancy problems were in my last ow dive when i switched to a back inflate bcd (ladyhawk) rather than jacket. same weight (28lbs). i could not stay down for the life of me. it was difficult to attain neutral buoyancy, when i did i could not hover because my feet would float up. didn’t have that problem earlier on dive 3 with the jacket bcd. added 1.5lb ankle weights, same problem. my dry suit and bcd would be almost completely empty but i would still start ascending. 

i’m planning on going out this weekend with my buddy to one of the dive sites we got certified at, in order to just stay pretty shallow and work on buoyancy. i was wondering if i could get some troubleshooting help to start in a good place with weight and trim, and then i’ll know what buoyancy problems are from me and what are from equipment. 

i’m 5’3”, 105lbs, low body fat. i was dressed in quite a few layers, sweatpants and fleece pants under the actual drysuit fleece, and super thick fleece socks that i think were possibly contributing to the buoyancy issues. diving in saltwater in a shell type dry suit, aluminum tank, 5mm hood and gloves. mainly using my bcd for buoyancy, minimal air in the suit. 

weight calculators are telling me anywhere from 19-32 lbs which is quite a range. even once i added 3lb ankle weights (31lbs), i had serious problems staying down, so i’m not sure if it’s a weight issue. like i said, the problems got 10x worse when i was using the ladyhawk bcd, which is what i’ll be using this weekend. i had weights in the trim pockets behind my shoulder blades - i’m wondering if they were pushing my shoulders down, hence the feet up? i had 4lbs in each of those pockets, then 10lbs in each integrated weight pocket. my fins were pretty positively buoyant, they were just the rentals. 

we did a weight check the morning dive (i sunk just under the surface with an empty bcd, but while breathing i think), but not the second dive with the new bcd. i could descend at the beginning of that second dive though. 

any ideas what could be changed to help me stay down next time, without just adding more weight?",advic fine tune weight trim help buoyancyhi everyon post littl ago frustrat open water cours dri suit happi report abl finish cours get certifi feel confid except buoyanc know someth everi new diver learn want tip weight trim biggest buoyanc problem last ow switch back inflat bcd ladyhawk rather jacket weight lb could stay life difficult attain neutral buoyanc could hover feet would float problem earlier jacket bcd ad lb ankl weight problem dri suit bcd would almost complet empti would still start ascend plan go weekend buddi one site got certifi order stay pretti shallow work buoyanc wonder could get troubleshoot help start good place weight trim know buoyanc problem equip lb low bodi fat dress quit layer sweatpant fleec pant actual drysuit fleec super thick fleec sock think possibl contribut buoyanc issu saltwat shell type dri suit aluminum tank mm hood glove mainli use bcd buoyanc minim air suit weight calcul tell anywher lb quit rang even ad lb ankl weight lb seriou problem stay sure weight issu like said problem got x wors use ladyhawk bcd use weekend weight trim pocket behind shoulder blade wonder push shoulder henc feet lb pocket lb integr weight pocket fin pretti posit buoyant rental weight check morn sunk surfac empti bcd breath think second new bcd could descend begin second though idea could chang help stay next time without ad weight

1,"feeling discouraged during open-water course - how can i improve?i had the last session of my padi open water course today, which focused on dry suit skills (we will need them for our open water dives this weekend). it took me a long time to figure out hovering and swimming in the dry suit, and then we had to practice ascending feet first and turning ourselves over and getting back down. 

i did this skill for about an hour straight - i just couldn’t get it. there’s two instructors for my class, and one of them took me to the side to do it. i was so frustrated and she just kept telling me to do it again. once or twice when i couldn’t get down before hitting the surface, she came up and explained what i was doing wrong. i’d try to implement it but no luck. finally she let me try a different way and i got that one after a few tries. 

by then i was tired and beyond frustrated. then we had to practice breathing from a free-flowing reg. i was behind the rest of the class, and the instructor kind of hurriedly showed me and got visibly impatient when i was hesitant to do it. i couldn’t understand that it was air, it felt like i was breathing in water. the air knocked my mask off one time which made me panic more, but i managed to calm down and replace and clear it. it knocked it off a second time, and the rest of the class was surfacing and i just got so stressed out, i booked it to the surface and started crying. the instructor came up and asked me what was going on. i couldn’t speak for a second as i was crying and very embarrassed and she said “thats not an answer”. i get she doesn’t have time to deal with this, but she just seemed so annoyed, and i was beyond frustrated at myself. i went down and did it again and got it this time, and then we were done. 

i’m just so unhappy with how the class went, and i start crying when i think of going for my ocean dives this weekend. i feel stupid, and im afraid im going to have an awful time on my ocean dives and just fail the class. before this, when we just wore the wetsuits, i thought i was doing pretty well. but now i’m feeling discouraged and embarrassed.

1,"dive report and review of rainbow reef11 dives over four days, including the aow course and nitrox ticket. 8 wreck dives, 5 deep, one night, in all. 

key largo is a dope place to dive if you like wrecks. the spiegel grove and duane were my favorites, though many say the bibb wreck is their favorite - my computer wouldn’t let me get close enough to the bibb to know the deal there. we got to do some light penetration into the spiegel, which was just unbelievable to me as a newer diver. 

we went on a night dive to the brentwood wreck, and that shit was lit. 14 turtle sightings, some slipper lobster, and one giant urchin, which i was stoked about. no one else cared. 

rainbow reef is a large dive company. lots of boats, huge staff. if you don’t like timed dives, you probably won’t like rr. i don’t know any better, so it worked for me, but except for the ndl dives, time was always the limiting factor. eddie was my instructor and deep guide, and he was outstanding the whole week. boat crew in general were great; office crew seemed to be stressed all the time, not a great experience in person on that end of things. 

check in was either great or painful depending on which side of the canal you were on. caribbean drive side was great; ocean drive side was painfully slow. dunno why. 

weather in kl was outstanding this week. 75 and beautiful the whole time i was there. water was 71-75; i was on the chilly side of happy in 3mm. 

all in all: a handful of reef sharks, a couple bull sharks, 20+ turtles, some big ass urchins, more barracuda than one could count, a whole flotilla of man ‘o’ wars, and two puffers. puffers are the best, man. i missed a hammerhead on the bibb dive - apparently it passed right under the wreck line while i was pulling myself in. damn. allegedly there was a great white on the spiegel the day we went to the bibb/duane. pics or it didn’t happen. 

aow was a great course. way more fun than ow. i came into it with just 6 dives, and had a blast. we did the peak buoyancy, night and wreck adventure dives. 10/10 would do again.

1,"divemaster in indonesia, but where? weh, komodo, bunaken? would appreciate some help and insightshey guys! after a couple of dozen dives in the philippines, indonesia, honduras, croatia and albania i came to the decision that i really want to do my divemaster. 

i believe, that indonesia would be the right place to do it because of the good mixture of amazing and demanding dive sites. also, i am a bit familiar with the country, was there already there some years ago.

a few prerequisites i have set for myself:

* i already know that i don't want to stay at a backpacker party place and concentrate on my education. so, no bali, no gilis. 
*  i have some money to spend, but not that much. so, no raja ampat.
*  i feel ready to challenge some currents when i get rewarded with big fish and amazing corals. and i guess, i'm not that into muck diving, i guess.

after some hours of research, i found three places where i haven't been before and that meet my requirements - however, they also have their downsides:

**pulau we**  
\+ laid-back vibes on the island  
\+ cheap costs of living   
\+ found some diving centers (lumba lumba / monster diving) with very good reputation  
\- compared to the other ones not that spectacular regarding the dive spots?

**komodo**  
\+ world class diving   
\+ diving center (scuba junkies) with great reputation, great prices and a nice all-inclusive approach  
\- diving center is far away from everything else. so i would hang out only there for several weeks  
\- boat trips to the dive spots last &gt;1 hour, so i will spend lots of my time on a boat 

**bunaken**  
\+ probably some of the best dive spots in the world   
\- by comparison very expensive  


...and know i don't know which place to choose.   
i would be very happy if any of you guys could help me decide or maybe poke me in the right direction. or are there any places you would recommend that i might have missed?

i approached and held their hand and got them to focus on me. signalled slow and control breathing and got them to match their breaths with mine. i checked their air pressure to ensure there was nothing wrong with their 1st stage. after doing controlled breathing for a minute. their eyes returned to normal and they had their breathing under control and signalled they were ok. we spent another couple of minutes holding onto the line calming down. i asked if they wanted to surface and end the dive, but by that stage they were ok and wanted to continue. 

we continued with the dive with me by their side monitoring. after surfacing they told me they had no idea why they panicked. just felt like they weren’t breathing (even though they were), but after the controlled breathing exercise everything went back to normal and they felt fine.",done one yet rescu cours first experi panick diver last week grate train drill padi rescu cours done one yet would highli recommend addit knowledg experi gain recognis assist help around improv safeti definit worthwhil situat group descend line shipwreck reach bottom notic someon breath super quickli approach saw hold chest eye super wide dilat cautiou safeti watch ensur tri grab onto regul signal someth wrong respons focus question approach held hand got focu signal slow control breath got match breath mine check air pressur ensur noth wrong st stage control breath minut eye return normal breath control signal ok spent anoth coupl minut hold onto line calm ask want surfac end stage ok want continu continu side monitor surfac told idea panick felt like breath even though control breath exercis everyth went back normal felt fine

1,"eardrums medical problemshey!
for as long as i remember i had ear problems. many, many infections as a kid. it resulted in my eardrums being scarred (scar) now, as the doctor would describe it, from getting damaged and healed continously. i have a tiny hearing loss in one ear from that. i generally couldnt swim without earplugs, because i would get an infection at some point. once was swimming in a lake for almost 14 days on vacation without them. nothing happened. then boom, infection. now being 24 i always wear them if its a planned swim. i'm worked as a lifesaver so its not always planned xd.

as an early teen my father took me diving occasionally. just to try it. i was holding to his jacket with bonus respirator from him (however its called in english, you know what i mean). due to my problems i had it hard to equalize pressure. i couldnt get deeper than 4 meters. during one, my eardrum ""broke"". pressure wasnt feeling that bad and i thought im good on that depth. but, well. i believe that from there on i have a hole in my eardrum. dont really know why i didnt figured it out earlier or was it doctor said its gonna heal but it didnt and i didnt went for a re-check or whatever. its been years now and it doesnt matter. 

anyway i saw a doctor lately and im ""on my way"" for a surgery to fix it. now my question is: is there someone with similiar problems? if so, is there a chance i'll be able to dive? on my lifesaver course i did freedive to 3.80m. had to prove i can. apparently for some people its problematic. i didnt really had a problem with pressure. i did it in earplugs, but i dont remember if i tried equalize or not. anyway i had a hole in eardrum so it wouldn't work. i really enjoy open-water swimming, i would totally get into scuba diving. i wouldn't even have to buy equipment since my father and my uncle have it but dont really use it anymore xd",eardrum medic problemshey long rememb ear problem mani mani infect kid result eardrum scar scar doctor would describ get damag heal contin tini hear loss one ear gener couldnt swim without earplug would get infect point swim lake almost day vacat without noth happen boom infect alway wear plan swim work lifesav alway plan xd earli teen father took occasion tri hold jacket bonu respir howev call english know mean due problem hard equal pressur couldnt get deeper meter one eardrum broke pressur wasnt feel bad thought im good depth well believ hole eardrum dont realli know didnt figur earlier doctor said gonna heal didnt didnt went check whatev year doesnt matter anyway saw doctor late im way surgeri fix question someon similiar problem chanc abl lifesav cours freediv prove appar peopl problemat didnt realli problem pressur earplug dont rememb tri equal anyway hole eardrum work realli enjoy open water swim would total get even buy equip sinc father uncl dont realli use anymor xd

i just got my open water certification and need some help selecting the right wet suit. i've been to a couple dive shops but neither of them have a selection in smaller sizes unfortunately. i did get a decent idea for what i want to order though. 

i'm looking for something i can use for scuba, spearfishing, and occasionally surfing. i think i'm going to end up needing a 5mm and a 3mm to be comfortable year round but figured i would start with a 5mm, since that's what i would use this time of year (tampa bay area). 

after trying on a few wetsuits i've gathered i want something that has extra stretch for comfort, and mobility for spearfishing/surfing. i tried the akona quantum stretch and really loved it but unfortunately even the small felt a bit big on me. i'm 5'6"" and ~138 lbs and it wasn't a snug fit. with that kind of material in mind i've been considering a few that seem similar:

aqualung aquaflex https://us.aqualung.com/products/aquaflex-5mm-jumpsuit-men?variant=22322300813370

* i was able to feel the material for this and really liked it. i tried on another aqualung small they had and the fit seemed good. however, i don't feel super excited to spend $380 if i don't need to.

henderson wet suits

*  an xs seemed to fit me in another style but there's a lot of options here for material including thermaxx and thermoprene pro, which i think are the two stretchier options. 

can anyone comment on these two options or offer a better choice for a mobile 5mm wet suit that comes in smaller sizes?

i want to add two strobes on the camera and i'm looking for easy to use, robust and not too expensives ones since i'm not very familiar with photography for now. apparently the sea&amp;sea ys-03 or the backscatter mf-1 might do the job, any thought ? what should i look for when it comes to choosing the right strobes ?

1,"redundancy in ppo2 monitors for ccr diversmost rebreathers are coming standard with a wired controller and a hud. these are wired independently so that if one monitor goes out the diver is still able to watch the contents of their loop while they make their exit/ ascent. several units come without the secondary monitor (hud/ nerd/etc.) on stock units.

this is likely to keep costs down and try to bring ccr diving within reach of a wider audience. this raises the potential for a diver to lose track of their ppo2 in several ways: 

they could have a failure where the controller floods. i have had 3 shearwater units flood on dives  over the year (thankfully not wired controllers but it could happen). this should trigger an immediate exit/ surface but if you are using a rebreather you likely have some level of decompression obligation or distance to the surface. the solution is to flush the unit with diluent regularly to exit by ‘scr mode’ or to completely bailout. not a huge deal but still an added task and increased risk of something going wrong. 

oxygen maybe turned off or depleted. the diver should be checking the loop at least every 60 seconds but as the oxygen levels drop so does mental function. it is possible to have the ppo2 drop to hypoxic levels fairly quickly while working hard or ascending when the unit is not able to add o2 to the loop. it’s entirely possible for problem solving abilities to go out the window before the diver realizes they need to do something. 

divers become complacent. after a few hundred hours diving a unit, people become cocky and complacent. it’s human, it happens. divers stop checking the controller as religiously as they should and things can happen without them realizing. if the controller is on their wrist it can be an “out of site, out of mind” situation. even if 95% of the time the diver is excellent at checking the controller murphy’s law dictates that things will go wrong the moment they are task loaded and forget. 


technical diving has advanced a very long ways over the past few decades. it used to be that cave divers were taught to dive to 1/2 their gas supply plus 200psi. now we teach them the rule of thirds. continuous guidelines, redundant light and air sources, long hoses/ primary donate are all innovations made to make the sport safer. 

with the increase in popularity of rebreather diving i think it’s time to update the standard to require a secondary ppo2 monitor/ hud. at this point it is simply indefensible to advocate for a system that has a single point of failure without redundancy. 

this is a change that’s being pushed by several agencies and i think you will start seeing it implemented over the next year or so. it would go more smoothly and quickly if it had widespread support from the community. the quicker this is implemented the lesser the chance of a fatality resulting from this issue (again).

when we got certified, she had to clear her mask pretty much every 5-20 seconds which was a bother. the primary problem is the space between the bottom of her nose and her lip is extremely close. she's tried almost every mask on the market and almost every one has the skirt hanging over her upper lip. **the closest thing to good we've found is the tusa freedom line** which fits her face with a small mouthpiece only, but she cannot articulate at all with her deeper smile lines without the mask flooding.

this has led her to investigating full face masks which may have a lot of the same problems in terms of fit but are fairly expensive to 'find out' if they work - especially with covid which is making taking the class impossible at the moment.

we're wondering if this is something we should just deal with or if anyone here would have any recommendations or advice and/or has dealt with this before.

my questions are... are these types of experiences worth it? am i better off trying to get certified before my trip in february and doing a full day of certified diving? or am i better off just saving my money and bringing my snorkel gear for the 1.5 days and snorkeling from shore?",beginn advicehello plan send day cozumel februari look snorkel option certifi would like eventu tri understand differ offer compani littl confus look like mani offer beginn resort get two tank go day get shallow water end day question type experi worth better tri get certifi trip februari full day certifi better save money bring snorkel gear day snorkel shore

2. https://www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-custom-dgx-singles-harness-backplate-wing-reg-package , however with this one i would still have to find a computer.

1,"your dive lights using ni-mh or li-ion batteries?searching through the various dive lights in the market, some use li-ion batteries, such as 18650, 26650, and a part of them use aa /aaa ni-mh batteries. from different users’ choice, there appears to be different opinions in regards to what the best battery is on a dive light. 

as we know, li-ion battery has good power, low self-discharge, no memory effect, and can be stored for years, wildly used in dive lights now. as for ni-mh battery, it has a good capacity, favorable price but relatively high self-discharge, with memory effect. many divers agree li-ion batteries have better performance on their dive lights. while, some prefer dive lights powered by ni-mh batteries. they say the specific energy capacity is greater with several 18650, 26650, but the whole dive light is also heavier, bigger, which might negatively affect diving. if they want 2 hours runtime, lighter nimh also has more than enough power capacity for that.

normally when a tank is tested, it gets stamped with the date of the test, usually month and year.

except this time, instead of being punched 01/21 as would be expected, the tester seems to have made a mistake (or time travelled) and punched it with 10/21 instead. so now i have a tank that will in theory be able to pass visual and could be filled by unknowing shops a solid ten months longer than it legally should be without having a test performed.

the tank integrity isn't really under any suspicion, its nearly brand new, with the number of fills it has taken being counted on fingers at this point. however i am unsure how any shops will approach the tank given it is stamped with a date that is still in the future.

1,"diving in southern france/around setetl;dr: in search for dive spots in a radius of 2 car-hours around sete (france). any kind of recreational diving, max. depth 33m)


heyho guys,

i‘m currently planning the summer holidays (july) in the south of france and am looking for good dive spots and some general information. (given the pandemic allows it.)
we are planning 3-5 dive days with 1 or 2 dives each. (depending of the budged of my so, maybe even more.) 

can anyone give some advice on where to dive/rent tanks (air/nitrox) in a radius of 2 car-hours of sete? any kind of recreational diving with a max depth of 33m is okay.

also does anyone know what water temperatures to expect at depth in july?",southern franc around setetl dr search spot radiu car hour around sete franc kind recreat max depth heyho guy current plan summer holiday juli south franc look good spot gener inform given pandem allow plan day depend budg mayb even anyon give advic rent tank air nitrox radiu car hour sete kind recreat max depth okay also anyon know water temperatur expect depth juli
1,"what was your close call?the recent release and post about stratis kas' new book [close calls](https://stratiskas.com/closecalls/) made me think that it might be interesting, for those that are willing, to discuss our close calls and learn from each other both as instructors and as students. the purpose here is to open up the discussion about mistakes and accidents and how we can unfold the events to learn about the behavioral, environmental, and systemic actions that led to the situation. i think it's important to stress that it's easy to just say ""i never would have done x, y, or z"" out of the context of the situation and all that does is stonewall the conversation.

i'll start with my first incident - i don't know that this was a ""close call"" but it certainly was not a good situation to be in, especially as a new diver.

after my open water certification i got an internship at a local scuba shop and worked for gear and classes. in the span of a summer i went from open water all the way through rescue, which looking back was ridiculous and ultimately led to a separate incident because of this overconfidence that i gained due to my zero-to-hero recreational diving career. look up the dunning-kruger effect.

my first incident was during a ""deep"" dive for my advanced open water certification. it was myself, the instructor, and another student diving off a boat. the dive was simple enough, we were going to hit a tug boat at 80fsw, the instructor was going to run a reel, and we were going to follow. the instructor was diver 1, the other student diver 2, and i was last.

conditions weren't terrible for the northeast, but as a new diver they were a little daunting. it was cold and the visibility was probably about 10 feet. the instructor tied off their reel and we started making our way across the deck. pretty soon after, it felt like there was a strong current or resistance - and in the blink of an eye my instructor and dive buddy disappeared into the murk. i started kicking harder, thinking that it was current but i was going nowhere fast.

though a fairly inexperienced diver, i had the frame of mind to stop and grab onto the wreck (remember, i was thinking this is a current that was going to sweep me away). this at least gave me a moment to catch my breath and think about what was going on. i didn't really know what to think - i hadn't really prepared for a situation like this. i didn't have the equipment for my own free ascent.

thankfully, what felt like 3 days later, my buddy and instructor returned. i gave them the signal that something was wrong - my buddy swam up to me - and untangled the instructors line from around my tank and we completed an otherwise uneventful dive.

so, what happened?

i think there were a lot of factors that played into this situation, some of which could have been easily  avoided. firstly, the divers and the environment: it was cold and murky and we were new to diving and new to that environment. if there's one thing i would have changed, it would have been our positioning relative to each other - there was plenty of space to not require us to be in a single file line.  looking back, the conditions had me fixated on what was in front of me, my buddy, and assuring i didn't lose them - which certainly contributed to my proximity to and ultimately entanglement in the line. it may have been beneficial for the instructor, or at least where they ran their line, to be positioned somewhere else relative to us as well.

secondly, the dive briefing: i didn't know what dangers a reel posed and i certainly didn't consider the fact that it could get tangled around my tank. i believe the instructor could have briefed us about the use of a reel and how we should position ourselves relative to the line.",close call recent releas post strati ka new book close call http stratiska com closecal made think might interest discuss close call learn instructor student purpos open discuss mistak accid unfold event learn behavior environment system action led situat think import stress easi say never would done x z context situat stonewal convers start first incid know close call certainli good situat especi new diver open water certif got internship local shop work gear class span summer went open water way rescu look back ridicul ultim led separ incid overconfid gain due zero hero recreat career look dun kruger effect first incid deep advanc open water certif instructor anoth student boat simpl enough go hit tug boat fsw instructor go run reel go follow instructor diver student diver last condit terribl northeast new diver littl daunt cold visibl probabl feet instructor tie reel start make way across deck pretti soon felt like strong current resist blink eye instructor buddi disappear murk start kick harder think current go nowher fast though fairli inexperienc diver frame mind stop grab onto wreck rememb think current go sweep away least gave moment catch breath think go realli know think realli prepar situat like equip free ascent thank felt like day later buddi instructor return gave signal someth wrong buddi swam untangl instructor line around tank complet otherwis unev happen think lot factor play situat could easili avoid firstli diver environ cold murki new new environ one thing would chang would posit rel plenti space requir us singl file line look back condit fixat front buddi assur lose certainli contribut proxim ultim entangl line may benefici instructor least ran line posit somewher els rel us well secondli brief know danger reel pose certainli consid fact could get tangl around tank believ instructor could brief us use reel posit rel line

due to a shared love of the ocean we have decided to get our diving licenses. however, both of us have experienced pressure in your ears when diving deep while snorkling. and when going super deep my partner said she felt pain in her ears from the pressure. i have felt some discomfort, i assumed this was to do with pressure changes?
i'm sorry if this a stupid question, but is that normal, is it to do with the pressure changes. neither of us have had any other ear problems, and no lasting pain after diving down.

1,"honest review of the tecdivings ""divecomputer.eu"" dive computeralmost exactly two years ago i bought the ""[divecomputer.eu](https://divecomputer.eu)"" (sic) from [https://divecomputer.eu/](https://divecomputer.eu/)

it is made by polish manufacturer of diving equipment (lights and ccr-things) that decided to create a cheaper version of the shearwater petrel.

i was a very early adopter and probably the first one in sweden to own one, i bought it the day they opened up shipping to sweden. i bought mine for  €495 including shipping, it currently sells for €466 + shipping so significantly cheaper than a perdix.

i'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, and i'll tell you the story after 120-ish dives (both tec and rec)

**features**

* blue tooth (software update via bt)
* supported by libdivecomputer(subsurface)
* full zhlf16c with gf
* full trimix with  he/02 0-100%
* p02 setting
* aa battery powered, user replaceable
* internal compass
* several display modes (oc tec/rec), ccr, apnea, ""pure bühlmann""
* 10 different gasses
* possible to add/change gas under water

**missing features**

* air integration

my computer came with software version 3.0/hardware 1.0 (first version with wet contacts), (current latest is simply called nxp)

**story of an involuntary beta-tester**

initially, several of the stated features where missing, especially the subsurface support and  variable p02. apperantly, polish diver use max-po2 at 1.6 bar hardcoded.

the computer broke after only 4 dives, sent it back to manufacturer who found a defect pressure sensor, replaced it and sent it back. the process took a while but they had a support portal and could interact with them. once repaired it seemed to work fine and i updated it regularly with new patches from their supplied boot loader. it's will require some minor it-skills to get it up and running, but nothing major. the biggest change was when they released support for importing dives with libdivecomputer. again, some ""fiddling"" for it to work (had to manually create a com-port for paired device).

one annoyance was that the computer sometimes would suddenly reboot under water and loose all deco info. this is of course not acceptable and i made several inquires through supportportal with no/little response. i eventually found the issue (or so i think), a jolt/sudden movement could shake the aa-battery enough to loose contact with connectors. after cleaning the connectors, stretching the spring a bit and adding a layer of electrical tape to the battery the issue almost went away.

it would sometimes reboot in the surface after rolling of the side of the boat, i guess the ""jolt"" from that height was enough to upset something. but still, not acceptable.

i was about to just cut my loss and get a perdix, but thought that might give the latest version of hardware a change, so i sent it back to the manufacturer (hardware needs to be done by them obviously). unfortunately, corona struck and they pretty much closed shop, took me almost 4-5 months to get it back! (the upgrade was done free of charge, i only paid the shipping to them)

now it runs version 4.1 (i.e. not the very latest) but performance/stability is finally acceptable.i have had no issues with it so far (although just 40 dives in) but i still tape the batteries (old habit)

**so, how is it to use?**

the computer it self is roughly the size of an old petrel, it is a sturdy construction and haven't seem any issues with wear. the front buttons are easy to maneuver with but sometimes it's hard to press both with only one hand (when i have it mounted). this is only needed to turn on/off. all other operations are using only one button.

the one thing i do trust is the deco algorithm implementation, it matches 100% with friends shearwaters  and subsurface calculated deco. so, nothing to complain about here.

diving with it is easy, the screen has four brightness modes of which i only use ""cave"" which is plenty given the dark scandinavian waters. changing gas is dead simple, as is switching between screens.

battery life is about max 15 hours when diving in cold waters (&lt;10c). i tend to change after 13-14 hours of run time. (use standard non-rechargeable aa)

i've never befriended the electronic compass, it tends to ""flutter"" a bit to much and i find it very hard to use. i prefer an old school wrist mounted non-digital version.

it has wet contacts so it tends to go into dive mode by just being splashed, no depth needed. once in dive mode, most settings are locked. then you have to wait for it to ""dry"" enough to go out of dive mode before changing. it also stays in dive mode on the surface after a dive. (because it's wet), thus all dive logs has a tail of 10 min at zero depth. (fortunately subsurface cuts away this time)

i've given this feedback to manufacturer but no changes/response. (maybe fixed now, not sure)

otherwise, i'm fairly happy with it, now (given that the stability is maintained), the computer it self does it's job just fine with no/few bells and whistles.

&amp;#x200b;

**verdict:**

a fun experiment that now has resulted in a usable computer.  i'm not going to replace it if it behaves like it's doing now.

personally, if i should do it again, i would save up €400 more and get a perdix, mostly based on the manufacturers support capacity. they are a small time supplier trying hard, but nowhere near ""organized"" as big as the major brands.

if you have only exactly €466+shipping to spend on a full tec-computer or want to support some one else than shearwater, by all means! i would trust the latest version (nxp) , the performance/stability has increased with each release.",honest review tecdiv divecomput eu computeralmost exactli two year ago bought divecomput eu http divecomput eu sic http divecomput eu http divecomput eu made polish manufactur equip light ccr thing decid creat cheaper version shearwat petrel earli adopt probabl first one sweden one bought day open ship sweden bought mine includ ship current sell ship significantli cheaper perdix like take minut sit right tell stori ish tec rec featur blue tooth softwar updat via bt support libdivecomput subsurfac full zhlf c gf full trimix p set aa batteri power user replac intern compass sever display mode oc tec rec ccr apnea pure b hlmann differ gass possibl add chang ga water miss featur air integr comput came softwar version hardwar first version wet contact current latest simpli call nxp stori involuntari beta tester initi sever state featur miss especi subsurfac support variabl p apperantli polish diver use max po bar hardcod comput broke sent back manufactur found defect pressur sensor replac sent back process took support portal could interact repair seem work fine updat regularli new patch suppli boot loader requir minor skill get run noth major biggest chang releas support import libdivecomput fiddl work manual creat com port pair devic one annoy comput sometim would suddenli reboot water loos deco info cours accept made sever inquir supportport littl respons eventu found issu think jolt sudden movement could shake aa batteri enough loos contact connector clean connector stretch spring bit ad layer electr tape batteri issu almost went away would sometim reboot surfac roll side boat guess jolt height enough upset someth still accept cut loss get perdix thought might give latest version hardwar chang sent back manufactur hardwar need done obvious unfortun corona struck pretti much close shop took almost month get back upgrad done free charg paid ship run version e latest perform stabil final accept issu far although still tape batteri old habit use comput self roughli size old petrel sturdi construct seem issu wear front button easi maneuv sometim hard press one hand mount need turn oper use one button one thing trust deco algorithm implement match friend shearwat subsurfac calcul deco noth complain easi screen four bright mode use cave plenti given dark scandinavian water chang ga dead simpl switch screen batteri life max hour cold water c tend chang hour run time use standard non recharg aa never befriend electron compass tend flutter bit much find hard use prefer old school wrist mount non digit version wet contact tend go mode splash depth need mode set lock wait dri enough go mode chang also stay mode surfac wet thu log tail min zero depth fortun subsurfac cut away time given feedback manufactur chang respons mayb fix sure otherwis fairli happi given stabil maintain comput self job fine bell whistl x b verdict fun experi result usabl comput go replac behav like person would save get perdix mostli base manufactur support capac small time supplier tri hard nowher near organ big major brand exactli ship spend full tec comput want support one els shearwat mean would trust latest version nxp perform stabil increas releas

my ”problem“ is that i currently own a full setup including a jacket style bcd with a wing bladder. while doing ooa-drills i‘ve noticed that my current hose length makes managing an ooa-situation difficult as i have to stay offset to my buddy to not yank the reg out of their mouth. now i‘m thinking about changing the setup to a longhose but all materials i found online only show it in combination with a harness and bp/wing. my question now is if anyone has experience with this mix of equipment or what you think about it. do i need to upgrade my bcd before changing hoses?

2. is a wreck certification really necessary if i don’t plan on penetration, at least right away?

3. what is the typical cost of a dive charter?

4. is it common to find charters out of the cleveland/sandusky area? do trips book far in advance or is it something that can be done with short notice?

5. do conditions stay fairly stable during the ideal diving “season”, or is it more like sit around and wait for a good day?

6. are there a good amount of wrecks to keep me busy closer to the sandusky/cleveland areas?  i’d like to avoid temps under 45f or so and stay under 100 feet of depth until i get more experience.

my main issue is that i'm running out of air in 30-40 minutes when diving 30-70 feet. i ran out of air in 30 minutes last night on a night dive that was no deeper than 40 ft, everyone else hit 55+ minutes. on one of my dives yesterday, another person on the boat doing their open water certification (similar height/wt/gender) lasted a full 15 minutes longer than me under the water. i've literally been coming up, every single dive, essentially halfway through the dive. its really starting to frustrate me. diving with friends/girlfriend and missing half the experience just starts to get old i guess. 

i don't feel stressed or anxious, based on feedback from other divers my trim and buoyancy control are pretty good for my experience level. its frustrating that i can't find any answers other than ""dive more"" (based on research online as well as picking the divemasters brains). is there anything i can work on improving in the short term to increase my bottom time while i'm here.",suggest control air consumpt better owgreet recent got ow certif day vacat cozumel amaz realli great time tri understand improv skill realli enjoy far want improv lb decent physic shape main issu run air minut feet ran air minut last night night deeper ft everyon els hit minut one yesterday anoth person boat open water certif similar height wt gender last full minut longer water liter come everi singl essenti halfway realli start frustrat friend girlfriend miss half experi start get old guess feel stress anxiou base feedback diver trim buoyanc control pretti good experi level frustrat find answer base research onlin well pick divemast brain anyth work improv short term increas bottom time
1,"single tank wing and handheld light recommendations?hi everyone,

i'm looking for a couple of equipment opinions and/or recommendations.  

&amp;#x200b;

first: what's your favourite single-tank wing?  my set-up is as follows: i have a diverite stainless steel back plate, and i've redone a custom harness.  i have a diverite travel exp wing that needs to be replaced with something.  this is where i'm unsure of what's good these days.  the size was ok (but i could go bigger), but i found the stitching to be pretty weak on the rear dump and the low pressure inflator.  

&amp;#x200b;

my first wing lasted about 2.5 years of heavy usage (failed on the low pressure hose, one of my friends who was rough with his went through 2 or 3 in that time), my second lasted 4 years (heave usage then extended storage - lost it to dry rot), and this one is in its 3rd year of very moderate usage (no rot, well maintained, stitching is failing on the rear dump and low pressure).

&amp;#x200b;

the other thing: handheld dive lights, ideally aa or aaa batteries.  any opinions at all are welcome.  i suppose i would be in the 'medium' budget range, and could be in the market for two (not necessarily identical).  i've had a bunch of different lights which mostly just wore out eventually.  i remember one brand that seemed to tick the boxes, but corroded ridiculously quickly.  while i don't remember the name, i heard they had gone out of business.

while “normal” diving would not be a concern to me, it looks like by the very nature of the efr and rd courses as far as i’ve seen (exercises above the water surface, cpr, maybe others), it does not seem like it lends itself very well to measures like distancing or blocking respiratory droplets. 

im wondering if someone with experience in efr and rd courses before or, better, during the pandemic would be willing to comment on how realistic is to stay safe in these courses?

1,"macro and wide angle with the olympus e-pl9 without changing lensesi'm thinking about upgrading my underwater camera from a gopro 7. as an obvious next step i'm looking at the olympus tg6. since i don't want to buy every ""step"" in the ladder of underwater cameras, i'm also looking at slightly higher-end but still affordable models, namely mirrorless cameras. recently i came across the [backscatter review of the e-pl9/10](https://www.backscatter.com/reviews/post/olympus-e-pl10-underwater-camera-housing-review), that called it the ""best bang for your buck"" in underwater cameras, so obviously i'm intrigued.

what really appeals to me about the tg6 is that it is capable of taking macro shots as well as wider scenes without the need for a dedicated (wet) lens that needs to be changed. that means that the camera in its underwater housing without any additional lens is a very versatile camera for the amount of gear you're taking on your dive.

so my question is this:  
is it possible to equip the e-pl9 with a lens that would allow me to take macro shots as well as wider shots (e.g. of larger fish or a wreck) simply by changing the zoom etc of the camera? are there other ""better"" (i.e. with larger sensors) cameras than the tg6 that can do this?

1,"my first diving class experiencei've completed my open water course a week ago and want to share my experience with you. it was amazing! the best week of my vacation. was it hard? undoubtedly. it was demanding but fascinating work.

first day. we began with theory lessons and equipment configuration.  i asked other people about my instructor. it was interesting. many people said to me before, it's impossible to fail an open water class. that's not the case. it's definitely possible with him. i had begun to worry about it a bit.

second day. the first practice session. i sucked at everything! i nearly drowned myself while trying to put my fins on. i used fins for the first time, and it was a disaster. i felt like it's almost impossible to swim with them! my attempts had no success. i was swimming to the side, or worse - nowhere. moreover, it was hard to maintain my position underwater. i was constantly rolling belly up. i tried to clear the mask. again, no success there. i couldn't breathe with water touching my nose! it was upsetting and surprising. i used to swim underwater in a pool without any issues, but this was different. i spent a lot of time trying to learn to breathe correctly. i drank all the seawater. swimming is another thing. we had to go snorkeling to learn how to use fins. 

third day. after the second day, i was thinking about quitting. i was complete shit, was unable to do anything right. i decided to give myself one more chance. this day went a lot better. i finally learned how to swim with fins. it was quite successful. the funny note, i find frog kick easier than flutter. people say it's normally opposite. mask clearing was a problem. sometimes i did it, sometimes i drank water. my achievements by that day - dropping to the seabed, and accidental surfacing. i knew how it works, but actually doing it is a different thing. buoyancy control is a hard skill. 

fourth day. i did it! mask clearing is not an issue anymore. it was not easy but i did it. people asked me what did i see underwater. i didn't know. i did see my bottom timer and compass, i did see my instructor. i didn't pay attention to other things, haha. i became better at buoyancy control. ascents were black magic (i was about to lose control several times) but swimming at the level was quite successful.

fifth day. do you like math? i felt sorry for my laziness. i spent previous three days rereading my books because i didn't pay attention to formulas and equations when i read them the first time before the beginning of my class. i broke my mind with all that math stuff. scr, rmv, mod, ead, etc etc. it's easy to understand but you have to have practice in calculations to avoid stupid mistakes. the practice sessions went well. no more eating the sand. i was able to descend more precisely. i did a swim without a mask - i couldn't imagine doing this two days ago!

sixth day. ascending is hard! i was asked about my pressure on the ascend. while i was checking my spg, i accidentally ascended by 1.5 meters above others and had to drop my spg dangling and fix my buoyancy immediately. successfully, but it sucks anyway. i saw more videos of me. haha, i was better. no more swimming with arms. 

seventh day. we did two last dives. no more black magic - i ascended without issues. i finally understood how it works. he asked me what did i think about my performance. i remembered my awkward finning, instant dropping to the bottom when i was simulating an out of gas situation, almost getting tangled while trying to put on my gear in water, all those funny videos. i really didn't know. 

the good news, i was good enough. i successfully finished the course. there's a lot of things i want to improve though.

what could i advise to other people who are thinking about learning to dive? don't give up! there is nothing you can't do. you can see pictures and videos of me in my previous posts.

i am teaching the course social psychology of risk offered by charles sturt university (australia) as part of the degree bachelor of outdoor recreation.

while research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how participants perceive the associated risks in others activities/sports and, more generally, how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. to this end i have designed a survey and i would like yo enlist your kind help.

the survey data will be used by students to design adventure outdoor recreation programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and i will to use the data to write several research overviews.  the background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html)

if you are over 18 yrs of age, would you mind participating by filling out the survey, please?

the survey can be found at this link:

[https://www.research.net/r/advoutrecos\_out](https://www.research.net/r/advoutrecos_out)

the survey should take about 20-25 min to complete. 

**mobile device users** please be aware that surveymonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll right or down as well to see everything. i apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

i am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but i can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

all that being said my 3 year old columbia newton ridge plus have started to show their age and some of the tread is coming off now. i’ve also noticed that my feet and legs hurt after really long hikes (we did about 8-10 miles in on day trip in the porkies with more elevation than i’m used to). someone suggested resoleing them, but i’m thinking getting the shoes a pair of new laces and then giving them to my local salvation army so someone else can use them for hiking. 

all that being said i’m pretty uncertain on what to get next as an “upgrade” for my serious and longer hikes in the future.

here’s the boots i’m going between:

- salomon x ultra mid 3 gtx 

- oboz bridger mid bdry

- hoka one one kaha gore-tex

just this past weekend we went on a 3 mile loop trail with about a 580ft elevation change.  it was a bit of a struggle for us on some of the inclines.  all in all the trail took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes - 2 hours (we were taking quite a bit of photos at the start and then realized it was getting dark, so we packed the cameras and picked up the pace).  the week before we did a 1.8 mile hike that felt a lot quicker and easier.

i guess my main question, is what is the best way and frequency to build up our endurance so we can take on longer and more challenging trails.  i definitely don't want to just dive in on a 10 mile trail that i'm not prepared for, but i'd like to build to that and would appreciate suggestions on how i can do so efficiently without burning myself out too quickly.",best way build endur stamina friend recent move colorado realli excit start regularli see beauti state offer howev admittedli inexperienc past weekend went mile loop trail ft elev chang bit struggl us inclin trail took us hour minut hour take quit bit photo start realiz get dark pack camera pick pace week mile felt lot quicker easier guess main question best way frequenc build endur take longer challeng trail definit want mile trail prepar like build would appreci suggest effici without burn quickli

so, my question is, can anyone recommend a tube i can use as a replacement that won't make my drink taste like plastic? preferably something i can just swap the tube out for so i can keep using the valve and quick disconnect i have, but if that's not an option i'm open to getting another brand of reservoir and matching tube.

i have a little bit of experience doing 15+ mile single day hikes with tons of switchbacks in the mountains in new mexico and wyoming, but i've only ever hiked with my dad. i've never had to navigate and such myself. a trail that is hard to get lost on would be most ideal, because i don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to navigate. i'm going with a friend, and she's a complete beginner with hiking. we're both very fit female athletes. 

does anyone have any suggestions for which trails we should do that fit the above criteria? we're looking to see some beautiful scenery. we want to be tired and worn out after the hikes, but we also don't want to exceed our beginner capabilities. we want to stay safe and have a fun time out there hiking. 

not sure if i worded everything in this question correctly, as i said i'm very new to setting all this up myself without my father to guide me. any help would be greatly appreciated!!",advic spot near denver want day long denver want go trip denver mountain nearbi within min drive denver trail head look day shorter one sunris pm ish longer one sunris sundown mileag would obvious depend upon rel difficulti terrain elev chang mile probabl upper limit though decent amount elev chang difficulti trail want super short mile howev definit look mile depend difficulti elev chang littl bit experi mile singl day ton switchback mountain new mexico wyom ever dad never navig trail hard get lost would ideal lot confid abil navig go friend complet beginn fit femal athlet anyon suggest trail fit criteria look see beauti sceneri want tire worn also want exceed beginn capabl want stay safe fun time sure word everyth question correctli said new set without father guid help would greatli appreci

0,"how often do you actually take the ten essentials on a hike?i’m pretty bad for not taking the ten essentials when i go hiking.  a headlamp, sure, a little first aid kit, yup, a shelter and extra layers, rarely.

from what i’ve read, if you’re hiking longer than half an hour, you’re supposed to take the ten essentials with you.  most of the hikes i do are under 5 km, so i feel like it’s not necessary to take the ten essentials because i’m always no more than 2.5 km away from my car, even if the hike itself is more than half an hour long.

thinking about my own lack of the ten essentials has me wondering about other people’s threshold for taking them vs not taking them.

when do you take them?  (judged by distance, time, popularity of the trail?)

when do you leave them behind?  (do you always take them regardless?)

we plan to go out april 10-18. i know some areas will be closed but we are looking for recommendations to maximize our time. i don’t envision us camping out (we like nature but not that much; our backs like a nice bed). in addition to hiking, we like to explore nearby towns when vacationing to check out local eats and drinks (of all kinds). it’ll be april, but we have enjoyed paddle boarding and would probably enjoy low stakes water activities like kayaking or canoeing on easy waters.

with that being said

looking for recommendations for the following: 

1. best place to fly into (seems las vegas has been what a lot of people do and make a loop)

2. what places to see and how much time to spend there to maximize our time and places we could skip out on. 
    - places that we definitely want to make our way to: zion park, bryce canyon, arches. grand canyon, lake powell and escalante.

i would say i’m a very experienced hiker however i have never done anything like the narrows, i.e. wading through a river for multiple miles. i have proper hiking boots but i will be doing multiple trails in multiple parks during my 2 week trip and am looking to avoid blisters. would y’all recommend that i wear old tennis shoes rather that hiking boots? or should i rent gear from the park (i have heard that is a thing, hoping to confirm)? the trail looks awesome and i’m not worried about the physical aspect of it, it is just something i have never done and i don’t want poor judgement on how to avoid blisters to ruin the rest of my trip. any gear recommendations or any information in general would be greatly appreciated. thank you so much!

after about 1 year, the vibram sole chunked on one of the boots. i left it alone  and now i need to deal with it since it is clear it won't make the 2 year end date. they can be resoled for $100, but if i spend that much the money will be going to a new pair of boots instead.

i have no experience with this but the patch adhesive needs to stick both to leather and rubber, but i'm not sure what products to use. i've been using duct tape so the tape wears instead of the leather. i looked at the auto parts store for adhesive and jbweld had some rubber welding product i considered using. not sure if that will work?

in july i'm off to a hiking experience that will last 5 long and sunny days. the route is in most parts very difficult (i will insert a picture below in the comments about what i mean and the ratings).

i desire to be able to hike it through and want to have my physical and mental preparations.

do you have any propositions on where to begin?

i was thinking of: running for 30 mins a day (after a few weeks i will build it up and start running uphill), standing on a tennis ball to build balance in my ankles, planks, crunches, squats, and lunges, work on some more cardio (not certain what i would do) and i'll be doing step-ups with my backpack weighted.

if you have any opinions on how much of that i should be doing, please feel free to mentor me.

one of our biggest focuses now is trying to make sure we have the right clothing for the weather. i've seen everything from average highs for the week of our trip being in the 80s, all the way down to the 40s. definitely planning to layer, layer, layer - but i'd love to hear from residents or from people who live in the area: what should we expect weather-wise? our tentative plan is leggings with t-shirts with a lightweight jacket in our backpack...although if temperatures tend to err closer to the 80s-side, i'd be dying in leggings haha and would prefer shorts. 

also just curious what desert-specific gear we may be overlooking. we have the basics from our hikes out in this area...but is there anything standing out in your head like ""oh yeah, you need x, y and z""?

that being said, my feel, while still sore this morning, felt mostly better so i made sure to lace up properly, took a walk around my neighborhood where we have some big hills, and my arches were killing me again.  heels felt better, but arches really sore, to the point they hurt right now as i type this at my standing desk.

0,"floridian day hiker considers water bottles vs hydration bladdershi everyone, i'm here asking what i imagine is a common question. i've seen *some* discussion about it on this sub, but the most recent thread is quite old...wanted to get some fresh takes:

water bottles vs hydration bladders

some buddies and i are going to start day hiking in florida. these will be flat terrain trips, the most common hurdles will be exposed roots, mud, puddles, etc. i don't have a proper hiking/outdoor pack and i'm considering a few options from osprey... i really love their warranty. the heaviest gear i plan to carry will be water. my biggest desire with a pack is functional storage - even if its limited. a spot to put my keys, a shove it pouch, an internal mesh pocket to hold some cards, some cash, etc. a lot of the packs i'm looking at (the skarab 18 and 22, for example) don't have this storage functionality. as such, i've moved up to looking at the skarab 30 (has a front shove it pocket and a small mesh pocket inside) and the widely adored talon 22. i don't think i *\*need\** a pack quite that large, but it could be something i grow into for more extensive hikes. 

the skarab 30 includes one of ospreys hydration bladders in the deal and the external pockets, from what i've read, are only *just ok* at storing water bottles. the skarab 30 is right around $130 usd right now. the talon 22 *does* have a sleeve for the hydration bladder, but it's not included. at $130 as well, i'd prefer to avoid adding the bladder if possible - $130 is already over my original intended budget of $100. if i go with the talon, i was thinking of getting two 1l nalgene bottles - or just bottles that i have on hand.

the choice i make will set me off on very different paths regarding hydration and, considering the up front investment, will be a choice i'll live with for some time. so i wonder... considering i *don't* own either of them currently... what should i consider when deciding between being a ""water bottle guy"" or a ""hydration bladder guy.""

bottles seem to have lots of practical advantages - easy to clean, would stand up better to things like sport drinks than the bladder, could be used in other applications (going to the beach, etc), and so on. the downside, as i see it currently, is the lack of convenience. would i find i have to stop and take off the pack in order to drink? if so, will i end up drinking less than i should? the advantage of the hydration pack, on the other hand, is exactly that - the convenience on the hike. but... i worry that i won't be motivated to clean it properly enough, so would i eventually ""forget"" to clean it and have to replace it? 

i'm wondering if there's anyone here that recently debated the two options themselves and what they considered and what they eventually decided. i'd also be open to different pack suggestions/setups, based on your experiences.

- it needs to cover me and my two kindergarteners.* i typically end up tying their coats to me mid-hike since there isn’t much room in the current (very old) pack. so i need room for all our layers +  lunch/snacks + 10 essentials.
- we are novice plus or maybe? amateur hikers. 
- i’d also love a real hip belt for support. 
- while i’d like to say we’ll be backpacking soon, we are still very much car camping and probably will be for awhile.

initially it looked like a 24 l bag would be the right size. but with the kid’s stuff too, maybe i need a bigger size? i also would love a real hip belt and some of the smaller budget friendly packs don’t have those. 

would my stuff drown in the rei women’s 40 daypack? osprey had a nice 24 l, too.

any thoughts?? thanks i’m advance!
