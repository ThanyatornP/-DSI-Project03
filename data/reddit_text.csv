1,"having doubts about night divingjust had my first ocean dive today in cozumel, and it was amazing. nice morning not ride out to the palancar caves and a second tank dive at the san fransico wall. went about 85 feet the first dive and 50-60 the second dive. my mom, who is decently experienced and went with me, and i planned a dive tomorrow morning and a night dive. i am having serious anxiety about diving at night knowing the shark species here and the fact there is no moon light and the boat leaves at pitch black. i am very concerned about being inexperienced and freaking out about getting into the water with an animal that eats at about the time we get in. i know sharks are very misconceived animals and won’t attack but at night we go in while they’re hungry and we will have lights shining in the water. i don’t know if i’m ready to dive with that in mind. part of me says “fuck it let’s just do it” but the other says “you sir are a dumbfuck you are intentionally going overboard into water with big apex predators with large enough teeth to shred you easily and at the time they are hungry.” i just don’t know if i should go

1,"solo trip to maldives nov- dec. 2021 - advice please!hello all! 

i am traveling by myself to maldives nov. 23- dec. 11 2021. i am planning but haven't confirmed, to do a liveaboard first then go stay on land somewhere. i understand the diving is broken. up into five regions and i'd love to do the deep south atolls, but maybe that isn't possible during the time i am there via liveaboard. in that case i'd try to stay at a resort after a liveaboard (or before) and do the south and/or any part of the deep south if possible. 

i am open water advanced and nitrox certified and trying to figure out which liveaboard to do, current considerations include; adora, or azeala...but i just started researching. i love rays and sharks and it seems those are both seen fairly regularly in the maldives.  i just want to make the most of my trip, and while i don't have unlimited resources, i will be saving up and know it's a more expensive trip overall. i have my plane ticket, but can change the date if need be, so if a week or two in either direction makes a difference, i am lucky i can make that adjustment. 

i'd rather avoid the heavy tourist/crowd times if i can, which seem to start towards the end of dec., but i do realize the weather and visibility get better. a little rain doesn't both me, but consistently rough seas are something i'd like to avoid on a live aboard. 

any advice on regions to dive, liveaboards and resorts in a region i will not hit via liveaboard are welcome. 

many thanks!!!"

1,"should i get a promate titanium barracuda or an aqualung argonaut? blunted or pointed tip?a lot of people say the argonaut is one of the best scuba knives available but to me it seems like a waste of money or too dangerous to go after if i drop it.

but it does look like it's actually a good quality knife 

the promate barracuda is only 60-80$ and is a similar length. i wouldn't feel too bad if i lost it. but the build quality does look a bit lower than the argonaut, especially with that plastic handle.

**should i go for the argonaut or the barracuda?**

**also should i get a blunted or pointed tip?** pointed tips seem... pointless, pun not intended, because i'm not thinking i'll be ramboing around the sea stabbing sharks like some gravy seal. but there might be some good in a pointed tip that i'm not seeing. blunted tips seem really good but would there be a time when i would need a sharp tip?"
1,"getting back into divingi just wanted to get some advice on getting back into diving after some years.

i started diving when i was 12 and i fell in love with it. i did a bunch of diving camps and built up my certifications all the way to divemaster and even got certified through my university as a science diver. however, after dealing with some heavy personal matters in 2014 and getting every single piece of my gear stolen, i stopped diving for a long time.

cut to now and i am at a crossroads in my life. i want to try to get back into diving again and potentially pursue it as a career path/get my instructor's cert. only problem is, where do i start?

it's been such a long time since i was diving last that i seem to have forgotten a lot of the technical information and skills. rather than show up to an idc having to relearn everything, what do some of y'all think would be the best way for me to build my skills/knowledge back up until i'm ready to make the next move? thanks in advance for any insight you might have."

i know that the us navy recommendation is no more than 75 fpm and i have seen that most people recommend 60 fpm, but is it still *possible* to descend faster? the depth i am looking at is roughly 130 feet, if that makes a difference. i'm not so concerned with how ascending works or how long you can remain at that depth, because i have ""magical fantasy world"" ways around that issue.

1,"how important is it to get certified at a dive shop near where you will live/dive long term?here's the deal - i currently live in nyc, and i'm moving to ca in september. i have long wanted to get scuba certified, and i was planning to do so as soon as i'm settled in ca. i know it's still cold over there, but i figure it's gotta be better than pursuing certification here in new york. however, i just got scheduled for a work trip to thailand in august. i could easily extend my trip there a week or so and turn it into a vacation, and that got me thinking - should i get certified here in the city before august, so i can dive while i'm over there? it feels like almost a missed opportunity to have this free airfare all the way to thailand and then to get dive certified literally one month later.  
but in that case, i would do the class and pool stuff here in nyc, and then the open water cert while there, along with a few follow up dives. does that process have drawbacks? i would have no dive buddies or anything on the trip or during the class, so i would be paired to a stranger while in thailand. i would then move to ca and have to find a new dive shop but would not really have the opportunity to take any classes there/get to know them, etc. or maybe i'm overthinking this whole thing! i'm just not sure since i have no experience with the whole process. maybe i'm putting the cart ahead of the horse, and should just not worry about diving in thailand at all?"

warning: my wife says i'm overthinking this, and i'm sure she's right. this question asks about the physics of buoyancy and air pressure, or something like that.

so, for example: on the surface (1 atm), my tank holds 80 cu. ft. of air at 3,000 psi. the tank is a single-walled device. pressure is evenly distributed throughout the tank. correct?

assuming it is correct, as i descend the air in the tank compresses. at 2 atm, the air is compressed to 1/2 of the original volume. the tank integrity is intact, meaning the tank itself is not squeezing or compressing, even though the water pressure around it has increased. so, why does the air inside the tank compress?"

however, i was really interested in the garmin descent mk2i, but the price was a bit harder for me to swallow. i also play golf occasionally, spin, and run so i thought the mk2 could be more useful but not sure i can justify the price difference. i additionally thought that maybe i would get a second transmitter to monitor my wife's air as well just for ease of not having to turn and ask. 

to add to it though, there is a slim chance i can get 20% off the mk2i, but not the transmitter."

1,"reflections on a return to florida's cave countryit's a mild evening in the low 70s as i cruise north along us-27 east of branford. past troy springs, blown out from seasonal flooding of the suwannee river. conditions that have reshaped my schedule for the week.

i'm heading to a country style dinner at momma t's in mayo and from there to sleep at my hammock in the back lot of dive outpost. i'm tired. i've spent the entire day at blue grotto on cave line exercises and simulated dive planning &amp; decompression. preparing for deeper dives on trimix later in the week at chassahowitzka wildlife management area north of tampa. 

i spent the first days of my trip at ginnie springs. going over buoyancy, trim, the four major propulsion kicks, mask/regulator/light switches, and much loathed valve shutdowns. over and over again until confident i could do them easily in a stress overload situation with multiple things going wrong. 

two decades ago, i completed an iantd technical cave certification over 18 months at peacock springs and 40 fathom grotto after multiple trips down to northern florida from my home state of michigan. i haven't been on a legit cave dive in 15 years. the roommate i got cave certified with moved to oregon to follow a woman and chase dreams of being a fly fishing guide. i got into a serious relationship that progressed to marriage. my career became a lot busier. my outdoor interests detoured to ultralight wilderness backpacking. then factors related to the covid-19 epidemic led me back to frequent diving beyond the annual tropical saltwater trip and summer great lakes wreck charters.

the reason for the 19 hour drive down here from grand rapids is to determine whether i want to spend the time and money for a multi-day cave refresher course. i've decided that's what's responsible before i return to any typical cave penetration dives. when i was certified in my 20s, the allure of cave diving was the challenge, the gear, the status. those young guy reasons are well behind me now. if i'm going back into underwater caves today, it needs to be for a serious interest in the caves themselves. also possibly cave photography in the style of sj alice bennett. a christmas 2020 trip to tulum that included dives at angelita, el pit, bat cave, and nic te ha has been my inspiration. 

driving along, i pass numerous trump signs still up months after the election. northern florida is a unique place. it's the rural, small town deep south rather than the genteel south of the carolinas &amp; savannah, the hillbilly south of appalachia, the urban south of atlanta, or the creole south of new orleans &amp; the mississippi river delta. i like it here. the people are friendly. it's relaxed -unlike much of the rest of florida which has just 2/3 the area of michigan but double the population and the crazies.

my mind wanders back to scuba. beyond the decision i need to make about cave diving, there's also the issue of sidemount. i still dive backmount. after having taken a sdi sidemount workshop last year, i'm convinced it's the wave of the future. not only for open water technical diving but also for recreational divers. the benefits for me are the added safety factor for solo diving and being kinder to the aging body. valve shutdowns are also hella easier.

then there's freediving. while florida's spring diving culture hasn't changed much in 20 years, there are two newer participants -the freedivers and their monofin mermaid cousins. freediving isn't a sport i thought i'd have much interest in. after speaking with a few of them and listening to their passion, i'm intrigued. like a seal, they're gracefully sexy in the water in a way that nerdy gear laden scuba divers aren't. freediving also has carry over benefits to scuba. 

fast forward a week later. twenty dives newly logged to my subsurface account. i didn't make it to old favorites like peacock &amp; royal because of the flooding. i skipped jackson blue, morrison, and vortex in the panhandle due to a three day detour to my parents' in bonita springs. but i was able to discover beautiful caverns at alexander and ichetuknee for the first time, shook fins with the manatees at hunter springs on the crystal river, and got to the bottom of buford without narcosis. i've come to the conclusion there's an xdeep stealth 2.0 in my near future. still uncertain about the free diving. 

as for doing a cave refresher in florida... as much as i love the culture and cave diving history of the suwannee valley and the beautiful blue-green glow of its springs, it's a lot faster and probably less expensive to fly to cancún, rent tanks and hire an instructor from under the jungle or protec than it is for me to drive 2,200 miles round trip on i-75. quintana roo's caves are generally more speleothemic scenic. tulum has street tacos 5/$2. i can hang my hammock on the caribbean. if i decide to brave the monsters of the deep rather than the ghosts of the maya, it's quick hop over to cozumel.

i've been working as a padi dm for about 3 years now and been diving for 5, my plan is to go to melbourne, study during the week and work during the weekends as a dm on some center (not a dive boat)

my main question and worry is this:

how feasible and productive is this idea?

my worry is that i've heard diving in first world countries is more complicated since dms can only do dsds under certain and very restrained conditions and they mostly are kept for surface support and maybe dlds aka only instructors make some decent money 

in third world countries padi doesn't really care that much so there is much more freedom, as a dm i've done practically every single activity i'm capable of and with a much, much more difficult and colder sea. obviously always with the approval and trust of an instructor but not as restrained by him being ""on the water""

lastly, do you make any money at all? is it enough to make a humble living?

i think that is about all of the doubts i have

looking for some advice on a new new computer.

background: i'm an active instructor, have been for last 6 years, always use suunto zoop because that's what my students used and super user friendly. now working on a yacht, instructor not my main role.

want: something smaller. i'm a small female, as much as i loved my zoop it was huge on my wrists. something that will also log my freediving. 

anything else i am open to suggestions... what's worked for you? 

thanks so much

1,"cabo - shore diving?looking at a birthday dive trip this summer with some buddies, and one of the locations we're tossing around is cabo.

of course there are plenty of charter boats in the area, but we mostly learned to dive together when we were all living in hawaii. as a  result we got pretty spoiled by the steep shelves off the islands -- so  our ideal experience is one where we can throw some gear in the (rental) car, park at a beach, and swim out to a dive spot where we spend a few hours in the water with occasional surface/snack breaks. we don't necessarily need anything super deep, anywhere  with 10m+ of depth and some pretty coral or interesting marine life/features to photograph is enough to keep us happy. (i should maybe also mention: we are mostly free divers, but we're all scuba certified and will probably do some tank diving on this trip.)

any recommendations for spots in/around cabo that match that general description?"

1,"belize vs. cozumel vs. cayman islands vs. hawaiiplanning a trip this fall...october most likely. possibly september or november, but it will depend on my employer. 

i'm lucky enough to be in a position where i might very well be able to ask for 4 weeks off in a row. we get 3 weeks already, and i might be able to do something like save up a little bit past a full calendar year and take advantage of an extra week stacking on top of the 3 from before. 

we'll see. 

so i want to plan this out ahead of time. please rep your favorite place here and what it has to offer in terms of diving. 

also, i will not be able to go to more than 2 of these places at once...honestly, i don't like bouncing around too much, and the flight costs will add up. not to mention the time cost of having to pack and unpack on traveling days, etc. 

i will also not be able to do liveaboards. visiting with my mom who is not a diver and is a very 'relaxed' personality who enjoys just simply relaxing. 

i have my ow, aow, deep diving, aquatic life id (whatever is the one where you just learn what fish to look for), buoyancy, underwater navigation, and maybe 3 other dives under my belt. 

i was certified in puerto rico in late 2018. that was where i got all those certs and the first and last time i dived. 

i've been a lifelong competitive swimmer. grew up with it so being in the water isn't hard for me. 

other than the **obvious** major bucket list items if you loved your visit i'd definitely like to know why. i need to make this trip really worthwhile b/c i prefer taking long vacations instead of quick short trips every 2 months or so. so it's going to be quite some time before i get a chance to go diving anywhere cool for a while. 

here's what i know so far:

belize = great blue hole and 2nd largest barrier reef

cozumel = extension of belize barrier reef, cenotes not too far away

cayman = wall diving

hawaii = manta rays and stuff. 

also my budget for this trip will be (let's just say a tentative) $2,000 a week...total. i already understand that hawaii will likely be the one that pushes most against this limit, but like i said...i've got a longggggg time before i go diving anywhere near as fantastic as places like this. so if i have to yolo my finances a bit then i'm willing to go a little extra. 

thank you very much all."
1,"suba diving has been a dream of mine since i was a child. what would be the cheapest way i can achieve this dream?ever since i was a child, i have been in love with the idea of scuba diving. it seems like it would be like entering a dream and is the only thing on my bucket list. it's the only thing i would regret not doing if i died tomorrow. 

i am on disability (my disability would not affect my ability to dive) so there's not a lot i can do with $13,000 a year. that said, i can put a little away here and there and maybe i can do this in a few years.

when i say cheapest i'm talking all expenses. from travel costs,  hotel prices, rental equipment, and food. i would imagine diving in the bahamas would be more expensive than taking a bus to florida. i know nothing about diving and am using these places as an example because a bus ride to a place like florida coupled with their hotel and restaurant prices would probably be cheaper than flying to the bahamas and paying tourist prices for everything. 

that said, this is a literal dream of mine so i'd rather pay $5000 to dive in a beautiful underwater world vs $1200 to snorkel in dirty boring florida water (again this is all hypothetical).

i live in michigan usa so that gives you an idea of where i'm traveling from. with absolutely no suba diving experience or gear, what would be the cheapest way to experience this dream?"

if you were to drag a fish or other aquatic animal to the surface rapidly, is there a chance they might develop a fatal embolism, or is that a scientific certainty? or was i right in the first place, and water-breathing creatures are immune to air embolisms? please help, i'm terribly confused. 😵"

my bf is not a diver, but we will be going on a dive-centric trip out of country in mid-april. he will likely be snorkeling. he might also try a discover scuba session if he's feeling comfortable.

* *i'm unsure if he should have dive accident insurance...or if maybe just trip insurance would cover him if he were to get hurt.*

i also notice that ""named water sports"" are not covered within 50 miles of home? i live in florida, so that seems pointless and a high chance he/i could be within 50 miles of home. we both like to fish (and deep sea fish), and it sounds like this isn't covered either through named water sports (regardless of being 50 miles away or not).

i will call dan directly to get clear answers on these concerns before getting him coverage (if any), but just thought i'd post here too if anyone is super familiar with the coverage/exclusions.

the [handbook](https://media.dan.org/cms/dan-nufic-guardian-handbook-fl.pdf) (florida) doesn't even mention jet skis but does specifically call out that parasailing is not covered. i guess i need them to clarify that. 

it really leaves things in question when even the handbook doesn't fully explain everything.

1,"help: wide face, leaky maskhey folks, hoping to get some advice from the community on this.

tl;dr
i have a wide face and eye “dimples” which cause a mask to leak and can’t seem to find the right fit

backstory: about 4 years ago, i went on a snorkeling trip with a tour company in grand turk. long story short, i spent about 10 minutes total in the water because the tour provided mask was terribly leaky and i was having a real issue with salt water in my eyes.

fast forward to today: i’ve got another snorkeling trip booked for next month in key west and i decided to be proactive in buying my own mask for this trip. i went into a local dive shop and after testing some masks, ended up going with a tusa freedom hd at the advice of the shop’s owner. he let me know this was really my best bet because i have a pretty large head and face to go along with it and that one did the best job at covering enough of my face.

took the mask home and decided to test it out and lo and behold, i’m still having the exact same issue as i did all those years ago. through some trial and error, i’ve pinpointed the leaking issue to the corners of my eyes on both sides of my head. it seems like i have something like an eye “dimple” and the mask isn’t getting a proper seal around it. 

with some testing and adjusting the mask (loosening it since apparently that’s a thing), i’ve got it down to a minimal amount of water coming in if i can get the mask to go on just right.

what i’m worried about is that when i get to florida and i’m out in the open water, it’s going to be incredibly difficult to get the mask fit just right, especially if i have to expel some water out of the mask (dive shop owner told me to look up and blow out, which is super helpful). 

so what i’m wondering is if you guys have any suggestions on how to mitigate this issue. should i look into a different style of mask or a different brand? should i tape the skirt with some athletic tape to hold it down where the “dimples” are? would a full face mask snorkel be a better option?

i’m open to all of your ideas, unfortunately, everything on the internet just says shave your face and get a good fitting mask, so that’s why i’ve come to the experts!

thanks in advance!

edit:
i ended up purchasing a seac libera full face mask just to give it a shot and it works with a great seal! thanks for everyone’s input! if i end up pursuing getting scuba certified, which is something i’ve always wanted to do, i’ll definitely be looking into some of these other mask suggestions!"

on saturday, 15 august 2020 the instructor, pat khokpool aka santi khokpool slashed open the left side of a tourist’s neck in the busy fishbowl beach bar on sairee beach, koh tao in an unprovoked attack. 

immediately prior the attack, santi had been assaulting a female tourist when the 28-year-old scottish tourist walked over and asked whether everything was ok whereupon khokpool instantly turned around smashing a beer bottle on the scotsman’s jaw then proceeded to slash open the victim’s neck with the broken bottle.

only excellent first aid and emergency surgery on the nearby island of koh samui prevented the attack from becoming yet another murder on koh tao, which has earned the tag “death island.”

shortly after the attack, khokpool was fired by ban’s diving resort, the largest scuba diving school on the island.  the fishbowl beach bar is part of the ban’s business.

it appears that the royal thai police have taken no action against khokpool who is a friend of the local police sergeant major “chet.”  khokpool has other powerful connections such as an older brother, saravut khokpool who is a police lieutenant colonel.

personally, i felt like 6 lbs was pushing it a little as the tank got lighter, but i was doing pretty well at managing my buoyancy with breath control. i think 8 lbs would have been comfortable. i'm not sure i would've felt okay with 4 towards the end of a dive. (i gather she favors minimum weight needed for a controlled ascent, and i was still able to rise pretty slowly with 6 lbs, although i did have a moment of scary floatiness she helped me recover from). 

10 lbs felt over weighted frequently, and i kept having to mess with air in the bcd or my feet would drag. 

so, i'm very confused now and have no idea what weight i should use. maybe i'm overthinking this and should just do 8-10 lbs, because i can always dump weight if i gotta, right?

in short : we are needing two bc/reg/computer set ups for warm florida diving (both ocean and spring), no plans for cold water diving, one set up for a smaller female. since we're buying two set ups, we are trying for more cost conscious options too. and i will be trying to support our local dives shops as much as we can, i've just felt very overwhelmed when going in, and feeling like they are just trying to sell us the most expensive options! i also feel like we get different recommendations in different stores, depending on what they carry. i've like to know what i want ahead of time, then go buy in store. 

thank you in advance!!"

i showed up there were (still are, still on the boat) many more people than i thought. i was paired with 6 others to one instructor. 

between two stops, i tried four times to get in the water and complete the dive. i was scared, my equipment wasn’t properly set up, i didn’t feel prepared. they tried to encourage me to go back down but i just couldn’t. i didn’t feel safe.

1,"having trouble with the mask removal skill (beginner diver)sorry for bad english, not my native language.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm trying for the first time to get my padi open water diver certificate. today i had those classes in the swimming pool. i found the exercises harder harder than i'd thought, but everything went fine and i could complete all the exercises in the first or second try, except for the last one, in which i had to take off my mask under water, breathe without the mask, put it back on, and clear the water out of it.

&amp;#x200b;

it wasn't easy for me to breathe without the mask using only my mouth, without letting water go up my nose. actually, and funnily, i can do it quite easily when i'm floating on the surface with my face down into the water, but, when i have to do it while kneeling on the bottom of the pool, i can only do it for like 10 seconds without getting water up my nose and kind of drowning. it's especially hard for me when i have to clear the water out of the mask, that's when it's most likely for me to get water up my nose and become desperate with the feeling that i'm drowning.

&amp;#x200b;

i tried this exercise several times, like ten times, and the instructor was getting kind of impatient (even though he tried not to show it) and i was getting more and more anxious and even kind of sad for not being able to complete the exercise. in the end, i almost made it and the instructor pretended that i had made it, even though i almost drowned.

&amp;#x200b;

now i'm a bit worried, especially about the scenario in which i lose my mask under water. is it common to have so much trouble doing this exercise? do you guys have any advice?

- having your own gear seems to be recommended so i was wondering roughly how much would make sense to save and if i should get a full set or just the essential pieces (i plan to hold off on the wetsuit until i need it unless there's a reason i'm unaware of)? 
- living in southern ontario, canada (with hopes of moving to nova scotia within 2-3 years) i expect to travel everywhere i can to dive and expect i will be diving in the snowy/icy months and areas aswell as the warm months. when i get a wetsuit, how thick should it be and is there anything about the fit i should specifically pay attention to?
- would it be far too dangerous alone?
- would i be able to practice in a chlorine pool to build confidence/muscle memory? 
- what are some key things to look for in the shop i plan to do the certification?  

i realize that i could google most of this but i find it sub-par in comparison to asking about personal experiences/opinions.

1,"neutral fins - deep6 vs rk3 vs ?hi all. i’m on a market for my new pair of fins - and looking for the neutral buoyant options.
i’m used to the utd neutral (and i loved them) but due to covid can’t get them in my area at all.
from what i know, the only other 2 options are deep6 and rk3 original. i’ve tried the rk3 today and they felt way softer than utd (well, maybe after 2 dives in jetfins) and a little bit wobbly towards the tip of the fins. has anyone had exposure to both rk3 and deep6? how do they compare? and what’s the general feel of deep6 (can’t get a hand on a pair to try unfortunately).

1,"is it possible to replicate hyperbaric oxygen therapy (chamber) with scuba gear?hi all,

first of all, i’m not planning on trying any of this so don’t worry. i’m just curious :)

i’ve seen some interesting research coming out of israel on the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. for those interested, i’ve shared a link below.

what i’m trying to figure out is whether diving with 100% oxygen at 2 ata would be the same thing? 

here’s a snippet from the paper detailing the treatment:

“our protocol included 60 sessions of 100% oxygen at 2 ata including 3 air breaks during each session in order to utilize the hyperoxic hypoxic paradox and minimize the risk for oxygen toxicity.”

if it is the same thing, then surely scuba diving could be an alternative? it would be really interesting to know your thoughts.

1,"bent myself for the first time. if you’ve been bent share your story here.did a long dive monday night (~3 hour run time including deco with an average depth of 80’) and got home late. because i had to work in the morning went straight to bed. i woke up 3 hours later (about 4.5 hours after surfacing) and was crazy itchy across my stomach. i was also swollen but thought in my half conscious stupor that i had just gained about 50 pounds over the last few hours. didn’t think much of it- slathered some caladryl lotion on thinking it was a bug bite or something and went back to sleep. by the time i woke for work it was much worse. all of my joints were achy and i now had a terrible rash across my abdomen and the swelling was pretty bad. with a clearer head since i had gotten sleep i realized what happened then. immediately started slamming water and ibuprofen and headed to work. i was watching for symptoms to worsen but they did not so i did not go to the doctor or call dan. 

now several days later the rash is nearly gone and the swelling is down substantially but is still present in a pocket just beneath my sternum. my abdomen is very tender still. 

the dove that did it was not my longest or deepest dive and my gradient factors were the same as they have always been. the best i can tell, i was slightly dehydrated and went straight to bed. i think had i drank a bunch of water after the dive i would have been fine. i was also unable to get comfy during deco because the cave at 20’ was a tight passage with gnarly flow so i was pretty tense trying to hold position. not great for off-gassing.

1,"ow limit - how strict is it?for the scuba police: i have never exceeded my 18m ow limit

with that out of the way - i am a fairly new ow diver &lt;10 dives after cert, and i was wondering about how strict is the 18 meters open water limit?  
obviously, if it was a blue water dive, with +/- \~5% guage inaccuracy, you would want to stay somewhat away from 18 meters, lest you find yourself at 26 meters without warning.

however, say i am diving on a reef that goes from \~18 meters to \~20 meters depth and i want to get closer to a particular organism/formation that happens to be sitting at 20 meters, would the dm running the dive be annoyed if i swam slightly deeper? would it be irresponsible?  (that being said, i have never done this, i was just wondering)  


and yes, limits exist for a reason, e.g. training level, narcosis, p02 etc. but how common is it for ow divers to exceed their depth limit without being cowboys?"

1,"advanced- padi or raid?hi all,

i did a thread search but couldn't find anything, though i'm sure it's been asked on here before (this might be the wrong sub). 

i did my padi ow a few years back, have about 35 dives under my belt, i figure now's a good time to get my advanced (i'm actually glad i didn't do the 'advanced immediately after open' thing that so many shops push....). 

looking around at local courses, there's padi ow, typically for about $500-$550 (aud), so i know how that looks - 3 shores dives, 2 boat dives, including mandatory nav/deep and 3 electives, usually peak performance buoyancy and 2 others

i noticed raid advanced 35, which seems to have 6 dives plus a pool session - although it's up to $750-800

so - yes, i know people could argue the relative benefits of different agencies until the cows come home so this is probably a risky question - but is the additional raid time worth the difference?  it looks like a more comprehensive course - is it worth doing this over padi?  it is significantly more expensive, but if it's justifiable then i can do that.  if it leaves me with more solid training and skills than the padi would, then that can only help me.  if it helps, i'm not entirely convinced that my ow provider was very good :p"

1,"please help us decide between the following 3 regulatorsmy wife and i are at around 80 dives over the last 7-8 years. we’ve started doing more regular local diving in san diego, and it’s time for us to get our own regs. we plan to do the gue fundamentals course in the next few months. 

i know with proper care and maintenance, regulators can last 20-30 years, so i’m willing to go in at the higher price point knowing that it’s something we are going to use for a long time. we plan to do a lot of southern california diving, and we generally try to do at least one longer yearly trip to somewhere tropical like hawaii, tahiti, quintana roo, or indonesia. we are interested in diving somewhere colder like iceland, canada, or alaska, but any diving like that would just be one-off trips. we don’t really plan on going the tech route right now, but that wouldn’t be completely out of the question either. 

after doing my own initial research it seems like the following three regulators are available and serviceable to me locally. and these are the ones that caught my eye the most because of their quality and features. 

- apeks mtx-rc
- scubapro mk25 evo + (s620ti, s600, or g260)
- hollis dcx + 200lx

i really like the swivel turret and number of ports on all of them, and the specs are all fairly comparable. the main difference seems to be piston (scubapro) vs diaphragm (apeks and hollis). i’ve been told piston has less moving parts so it should generally last longer and be more durable, and diaphragms are more rugged to withstand extreme environments. i have no idea what the different service costs would be. 

does anyone have a strong case for any of these 3 regulators that make the most sense for our situation if money isn’t a big factor?"

the biggest buoyancy problems were in my last ow dive when i switched to a back inflate bcd (ladyhawk) rather than jacket. same weight (28lbs). i could not stay down for the life of me. it was difficult to attain neutral buoyancy, when i did i could not hover because my feet would float up. didn’t have that problem earlier on dive 3 with the jacket bcd. added 1.5lb ankle weights, same problem. my dry suit and bcd would be almost completely empty but i would still start ascending. 

i’m planning on going out this weekend with my buddy to one of the dive sites we got certified at, in order to just stay pretty shallow and work on buoyancy. i was wondering if i could get some troubleshooting help to start in a good place with weight and trim, and then i’ll know what buoyancy problems are from me and what are from equipment. 

i’m 5’3”, 105lbs, low body fat. i was dressed in quite a few layers, sweatpants and fleece pants under the actual drysuit fleece, and super thick fleece socks that i think were possibly contributing to the buoyancy issues. diving in saltwater in a shell type dry suit, aluminum tank, 5mm hood and gloves. mainly using my bcd for buoyancy, minimal air in the suit. 

weight calculators are telling me anywhere from 19-32 lbs which is quite a range. even once i added 3lb ankle weights (31lbs), i had serious problems staying down, so i’m not sure if it’s a weight issue. like i said, the problems got 10x worse when i was using the ladyhawk bcd, which is what i’ll be using this weekend. i had weights in the trim pockets behind my shoulder blades - i’m wondering if they were pushing my shoulders down, hence the feet up? i had 4lbs in each of those pockets, then 10lbs in each integrated weight pocket. my fins were pretty positively buoyant, they were just the rentals. 

we did a weight check the morning dive (i sunk just under the surface with an empty bcd, but while breathing i think), but not the second dive with the new bcd. i could descend at the beginning of that second dive though. 

any ideas what could be changed to help me stay down next time, without just adding more weight?"
1,"scuba fin recommendations??hi everyone! what do you all recommend for ~$100 scuba fins? 

i’m a relatively new diver (15 dives) and i wanted to invest in basic scuba gear. i bought a cressi f1 mask and the supernova dry snorkel, but i got the cressi palua long fins. i’ve heard mixed reviews about these fins for scuba. i’m particular towards cressi (just for a matching set) and i’ve heard the cressi frog plus are good, but a bit pricey. would it be worth it to return the palua and get the frog instead?

edit: yeah forget the matching, i just like black"

1,"newbie asks about ear pain while scuba divingso about a year and a half ago i tried to get my open water cert while i was in indonesia.  i went through the written part without issue, but when i went into the water for the first time, no more than 10 feet, my ears would hurt.  not terribly, but enough that i would come back up, take a rest, and then try again.  i did this over and over and it never got any better, so in the end i could never go any further in my certification.

i would really love to go scuba diving though, and would like to try again, but i'm weary of spending all this money for certification only to find exactly the same issue.

i'm not asking for medical advice, i just wanted to know if this is common in the community?  do some people experience ear pain sometimes and not others?  i've had normal doctor checkups with nothing come up.  just thought i'd see if anyone had any thoughts.  thanks!"

i did manage to equalize fully but i had to push harder and longer than for my right ear.

i guess what i’m trying to get some advice on is i was looking on ebay and happened to find a guy selling a brand new mares abyss 22 navy ii regulator abs got it obo for 458 with tax so i think that’s a good deal and will be a great first regulator with the option of branching out to cold water diving. i know it’s not the first thing you’d usually wanna buy but couldn’t pass up that deal. what do y’all think? 

one thing i’m having issues with is what type of dive computer i will need i look at it like buy once cry once yet i don’t wanna spend 800 on something i truly don’t need. the computer that’s caught my interest the most is the sheer water peregrine but it doesn’t have air integration so not sure if that’s something that’s worth spending extra for. also getting most everything else at the dive shop they price match so i plan on getting mask, fins,bcd, octo etc. there. but  any advice would be great thanks and look forward to years of fun!"

second question... i was under the understanding that the $85 fee was a one time charge. however i've seen a comment from a guy online saying this is not the case and he was billed for a renewal. when i purchased the software license, i don't recall anything about use only being for a fixed period of time. is the multideco license fee for lifetime use or does it need to be renewed annually?"

1,"sidemount questionsi'm diving backmount now. however, i'm considering setting up a sidemount system for northern florida &amp; the yucatan as well as shore diving closer to home in the great lakes region. when i took my sidemount class in december, i dove with both a hollis sms 75 and the apeks version of the razor and preferred the simplicity of the mexican style system.

now for the questions...

1. when i was diving in the yucatan in december, my guide recommended a razor clone to me that he said costs us$200 less than the razor and that many of the mexican guides and instructors use. i wrote the name down but lost my notes. any guesses to what it is? i can't find anything like that online. i'm wondering if they're buying them from aliexpress or some chinese knockoff site like that.
2. i currently own a single pst hp 100 and a rather new al catalina s80. i'm undecided whether i should hunt for another pst hp 100 or purchase another al catalina s80 to create a sidemount set. the steel tanks would allow me to add less lead \[-8.8 full/-1.3 empty vs. -1.8 full/4.0 empty\] and provide greater gas supply. the aluminum would allow me to become familiar with the buoyancy and trim of al 80 rental tanks in mexico and other overseas destinations."

so i checked online and seems like i got it offered for a decent price but i wanted to know some personal opinions about it, and if there would be any better dive computer for that price/quality."

1,"regarding next-gen dive computershi guys, i’ve recently got into diving and now open water certified and about to be advanced certified in the coming week. 

i recently purchased a shearwater peregrine and it’s fantastic, but i’d really like to have a top-of-the-line dive computer with ai and a compass. i would’ve purchased a teric or even a suunto d5, but my concern is that the next generation of the aforementioned dcs may be released soon. i just have an inkling that diver computers are, just now, entering the modern-day array of rapidly evolving tech. whereas the marginal improvements in smartphones are decelerating, i feel that dive computers have a long way to go before reaching this “plateau.”

for those of you that’ve dived for a while and at the same time likes shiny new things, how often does shearwater or suunto release newer iterations of their dive computers?"
1,"feeling discouraged during open-water course - how can i improve?i had the last session of my padi open water course today, which focused on dry suit skills (we will need them for our open water dives this weekend). it took me a long time to figure out hovering and swimming in the dry suit, and then we had to practice ascending feet first and turning ourselves over and getting back down. 

i did this skill for about an hour straight - i just couldn’t get it. there’s two instructors for my class, and one of them took me to the side to do it. i was so frustrated and she just kept telling me to do it again. once or twice when i couldn’t get down before hitting the surface, she came up and explained what i was doing wrong. i’d try to implement it but no luck. finally she let me try a different way and i got that one after a few tries. 

by then i was tired and beyond frustrated. then we had to practice breathing from a free-flowing reg. i was behind the rest of the class, and the instructor kind of hurriedly showed me and got visibly impatient when i was hesitant to do it. i couldn’t understand that it was air, it felt like i was breathing in water. the air knocked my mask off one time which made me panic more, but i managed to calm down and replace and clear it. it knocked it off a second time, and the rest of the class was surfacing and i just got so stressed out, i booked it to the surface and started crying. the instructor came up and asked me what was going on. i couldn’t speak for a second as i was crying and very embarrassed and she said “thats not an answer”. i get she doesn’t have time to deal with this, but she just seemed so annoyed, and i was beyond frustrated at myself. i went down and did it again and got it this time, and then we were done. 

i’m just so unhappy with how the class went, and i start crying when i think of going for my ocean dives this weekend. i feel stupid, and im afraid im going to have an awful time on my ocean dives and just fail the class. before this, when we just wore the wetsuits, i thought i was doing pretty well. but now i’m feeling discouraged and embarrassed. 

my questions are - how do i prevent a similar situation from happening again? any dry suit divers have tips for buoyancy? any instructors ever seen a student cry? i am so embarrassed about that, i barely want to show my face again."

1,"how do you attach your transmitter?moving to a hoseless air integrated computer. for those that use them, do you attach your transmitter directly to your first stage or attach it on a hose? i've read that it's common for people to put it on a hose to prevent someone else from attempting to pick up their tank from their first stage and possibly damaging the transmitter. i've also read that it should not be put on a hose as it increases failure points by moving from one connection/one o-ring to multiple including the need for a spool.

1,"dive report and review of rainbow reef11 dives over four days, including the aow course and nitrox ticket. 8 wreck dives, 5 deep, one night, in all. 

key largo is a dope place to dive if you like wrecks. the spiegel grove and duane were my favorites, though many say the bibb wreck is their favorite - my computer wouldn’t let me get close enough to the bibb to know the deal there. we got to do some light penetration into the spiegel, which was just unbelievable to me as a newer diver. 

we went on a night dive to the brentwood wreck, and that shit was lit. 14 turtle sightings, some slipper lobster, and one giant urchin, which i was stoked about. no one else cared. 

rainbow reef is a large dive company. lots of boats, huge staff. if you don’t like timed dives, you probably won’t like rr. i don’t know any better, so it worked for me, but except for the ndl dives, time was always the limiting factor. eddie was my instructor and deep guide, and he was outstanding the whole week. boat crew in general were great; office crew seemed to be stressed all the time, not a great experience in person on that end of things. 

check in was either great or painful depending on which side of the canal you were on. caribbean drive side was great; ocean drive side was painfully slow. dunno why. 

weather in kl was outstanding this week. 75 and beautiful the whole time i was there. water was 71-75; i was on the chilly side of happy in 3mm. 

all in all: a handful of reef sharks, a couple bull sharks, 20+ turtles, some big ass urchins, more barracuda than one could count, a whole flotilla of man ‘o’ wars, and two puffers. puffers are the best, man. i missed a hammerhead on the bibb dive - apparently it passed right under the wreck line while i was pulling myself in. damn. allegedly there was a great white on the spiegel the day we went to the bibb/duane. pics or it didn’t happen. 

aow was a great course. way more fun than ow. i came into it with just 6 dives, and had a blast. we did the peak buoyancy, night and wreck adventure dives. 10/10 would do again. 

i also lost my snorkel. good riddance. maybe a crab will use it."

1,"divemaster in indonesia, but where? weh, komodo, bunaken? would appreciate some help and insightshey guys! after a couple of dozen dives in the philippines, indonesia, honduras, croatia and albania i came to the decision that i really want to do my divemaster. 

i believe, that indonesia would be the right place to do it because of the good mixture of amazing and demanding dive sites. also, i am a bit familiar with the country, was there already there some years ago.

a few prerequisites i have set for myself:

* i already know that i don't want to stay at a backpacker party place and concentrate on my education. so, no bali, no gilis. 
*  i have some money to spend, but not that much. so, no raja ampat.
*  i feel ready to challenge some currents when i get rewarded with big fish and amazing corals. and i guess, i'm not that into muck diving, i guess.

after some hours of research, i found three places where i haven't been before and that meet my requirements - however, they also have their downsides:

**pulau we**  
\+ laid-back vibes on the island  
\+ cheap costs of living   
\+ found some diving centers (lumba lumba / monster diving) with very good reputation  
\- compared to the other ones not that spectacular regarding the dive spots?

**komodo**  
\+ world class diving   
\+ diving center (scuba junkies) with great reputation, great prices and a nice all-inclusive approach  
\- diving center is far away from everything else. so i would hang out only there for several weeks  
\- boat trips to the dive spots last &gt;1 hour, so i will spend lots of my time on a boat 

**bunaken**  
\+ probably some of the best dive spots in the world   
\- by comparison very expensive  


...and know i don't know which place to choose.   
i would be very happy if any of you guys could help me decide or maybe poke me in the right direction. or are there any places you would recommend that i might have missed? 

thanks so much in advance for your help!"

1,"if you haven’t done one yet, do a rescue course.i had my first experience with a panicked diver last week, and i’m very grateful for the training and drills i did during my padi rescue course. if you haven’t done one yet, i would highly recommend it. any additional knowledge and experience you can gain in recognising and assisting to help both yourself and those around you improves safety and is definitely worthwhile. 

the situation: 
in a group of 4 we descended a line to a shipwreck at 17m. once reaching the bottom i noticed someone breathing super quickly. i approached them and saw that they were holding their chest and their eyes were super wide and dilated. 

being cautious of my safety and watching them to ensure they didn’t try and grab onto me or my regulators. i signalled to them if their was something wrong, and had no response they weren’t focusing on me or my question. 

i approached and held their hand and got them to focus on me. signalled slow and control breathing and got them to match their breaths with mine. i checked their air pressure to ensure there was nothing wrong with their 1st stage. after doing controlled breathing for a minute. their eyes returned to normal and they had their breathing under control and signalled they were ok. we spent another couple of minutes holding onto the line calming down. i asked if they wanted to surface and end the dive, but by that stage they were ok and wanted to continue. 

we continued with the dive with me by their side monitoring. after surfacing they told me they had no idea why they panicked. just felt like they weren’t breathing (even though they were), but after the controlled breathing exercise everything went back to normal and they felt fine."

1,"eardrums medical problemshey!
for as long as i remember i had ear problems. many, many infections as a kid. it resulted in my eardrums being scarred (scar) now, as the doctor would describe it, from getting damaged and healed continously. i have a tiny hearing loss in one ear from that. i generally couldnt swim without earplugs, because i would get an infection at some point. once was swimming in a lake for almost 14 days on vacation without them. nothing happened. then boom, infection. now being 24 i always wear them if its a planned swim. i'm worked as a lifesaver so its not always planned xd.

as an early teen my father took me diving occasionally. just to try it. i was holding to his jacket with bonus respirator from him (however its called in english, you know what i mean). due to my problems i had it hard to equalize pressure. i couldnt get deeper than 4 meters. during one, my eardrum ""broke"". pressure wasnt feeling that bad and i thought im good on that depth. but, well. i believe that from there on i have a hole in my eardrum. dont really know why i didnt figured it out earlier or was it doctor said its gonna heal but it didnt and i didnt went for a re-check or whatever. its been years now and it doesnt matter. 

anyway i saw a doctor lately and im ""on my way"" for a surgery to fix it. now my question is: is there someone with similiar problems? if so, is there a chance i'll be able to dive? on my lifesaver course i did freedive to 3.80m. had to prove i can. apparently for some people its problematic. i didnt really had a problem with pressure. i did it in earplugs, but i dont remember if i tried equalize or not. anyway i had a hole in eardrum so it wouldn't work. i really enjoy open-water swimming, i would totally get into scuba diving. i wouldn't even have to buy equipment since my father and my uncle have it but dont really use it anymore xd"

regarding a new bc, what are people's thoughts on bc's with the i3 inflator/deflator? my first instinct was that it looked fantastic, i always hated having to hold the inflator/deflator in awkward spots to let air out and this seems like something i could easily get used to. i've spoken to people at several different shops and opinion seems to be pretty mixed between love and hate."

my question: those of you who use air integration, do you use an analog spg as a backup? 

the air integration on this is supposed to be extremely reliable, and the battery life of the computer is excellent, so i’m not really worried about it failing. however, part of me still wonders if i should still run a backup spg. on the other hand, the whole idea of air integration to try and keep things streamlined. what is best practice in this situation? appreciate any insight. tia!"

how often do people actually ask to see proof and signed confirmation of past dives? i figure i could actually recreate the details of the log book from memory, but to be honest, i would be forgetting details and not everything would be signed off on. this course in particular is mostly about buoyancy and not destroying nature, so it’s not like it’s a high stakes thing like cave diving. i’m sure i am not the only one to do this.

1,"help picking out a first wetsuithi all,

i just got my open water certification and need some help selecting the right wet suit. i've been to a couple dive shops but neither of them have a selection in smaller sizes unfortunately. i did get a decent idea for what i want to order though. 

i'm looking for something i can use for scuba, spearfishing, and occasionally surfing. i think i'm going to end up needing a 5mm and a 3mm to be comfortable year round but figured i would start with a 5mm, since that's what i would use this time of year (tampa bay area). 

after trying on a few wetsuits i've gathered i want something that has extra stretch for comfort, and mobility for spearfishing/surfing. i tried the akona quantum stretch and really loved it but unfortunately even the small felt a bit big on me. i'm 5'6"" and ~138 lbs and it wasn't a snug fit. with that kind of material in mind i've been considering a few that seem similar:

aqualung aquaflex https://us.aqualung.com/products/aquaflex-5mm-jumpsuit-men?variant=22322300813370

* i was able to feel the material for this and really liked it. i tried on another aqualung small they had and the fit seemed good. however, i don't feel super excited to spend $380 if i don't need to.

henderson wet suits

*  an xs seemed to fit me in another style but there's a lot of options here for material including thermaxx and thermoprene pro, which i think are the two stretchier options. 

can anyone comment on these two options or offer a better choice for a mobile 5mm wet suit that comes in smaller sizes?

1,"redundancy in ppo2 monitors for ccr diversmost rebreathers are coming standard with a wired controller and a hud. these are wired independently so that if one monitor goes out the diver is still able to watch the contents of their loop while they make their exit/ ascent. several units come without the secondary monitor (hud/ nerd/etc.) on stock units.

this is likely to keep costs down and try to bring ccr diving within reach of a wider audience. this raises the potential for a diver to lose track of their ppo2 in several ways: 

they could have a failure where the controller floods. i have had 3 shearwater units flood on dives  over the year (thankfully not wired controllers but it could happen). this should trigger an immediate exit/ surface but if you are using a rebreather you likely have some level of decompression obligation or distance to the surface. the solution is to flush the unit with diluent regularly to exit by ‘scr mode’ or to completely bailout. not a huge deal but still an added task and increased risk of something going wrong. 

oxygen maybe turned off or depleted. the diver should be checking the loop at least every 60 seconds but as the oxygen levels drop so does mental function. it is possible to have the ppo2 drop to hypoxic levels fairly quickly while working hard or ascending when the unit is not able to add o2 to the loop. it’s entirely possible for problem solving abilities to go out the window before the diver realizes they need to do something. 

divers become complacent. after a few hundred hours diving a unit, people become cocky and complacent. it’s human, it happens. divers stop checking the controller as religiously as they should and things can happen without them realizing. if the controller is on their wrist it can be an “out of site, out of mind” situation. even if 95% of the time the diver is excellent at checking the controller murphy’s law dictates that things will go wrong the moment they are task loaded and forget. 


technical diving has advanced a very long ways over the past few decades. it used to be that cave divers were taught to dive to 1/2 their gas supply plus 200psi. now we teach them the rule of thirds. continuous guidelines, redundant light and air sources, long hoses/ primary donate are all innovations made to make the sport safer. 

with the increase in popularity of rebreather diving i think it’s time to update the standard to require a secondary ppo2 monitor/ hud. at this point it is simply indefensible to advocate for a system that has a single point of failure without redundancy. 

this is a change that’s being pushed by several agencies and i think you will start seeing it implemented over the next year or so. it would go more smoothly and quickly if it had widespread support from the community. the quicker this is implemented the lesser the chance of a fatality resulting from this issue (again). 

if you are diving a unit without a redundant ppo2 monitor please consider adding one. please. it could save your life."

when we got certified, she had to clear her mask pretty much every 5-20 seconds which was a bother. the primary problem is the space between the bottom of her nose and her lip is extremely close. she's tried almost every mask on the market and almost every one has the skirt hanging over her upper lip. **the closest thing to good we've found is the tusa freedom line** which fits her face with a small mouthpiece only, but she cannot articulate at all with her deeper smile lines without the mask flooding.

this has led her to investigating full face masks which may have a lot of the same problems in terms of fit but are fairly expensive to 'find out' if they work - especially with covid which is making taking the class impossible at the moment.

we're wondering if this is something we should just deal with or if anyone here would have any recommendations or advice and/or has dealt with this before.

thanks!"

i'm a new diver, just got my aow certification last month, and i would like to buy my own gear. i've been doing a lot of research lately and reading a lot of articles on this sub, and it has been very helpful and i've narrowed it down to the following options, so please let me know what you think (or if you have any other equipment in mind) given that:

* i'm a beginner who would only be doing recreational diving for at least 2 or 3 years before even thinking about technical diving, also i think mostly warm water.
* i will probably be traveling a lot with my equipment so lighter equipment is a factor.
* i live in europe so maintenance and returns is not easy with something like dgx  (as compared with equipment bought from lds) however i've seen their equipment being recommended a lot on this sub and that's why i'm considering it. so if buying online, i would prefer to be able to maintain the equipment myself without too much difficulty.

1. for kubi and other ring replaceable dry glove systems, what's a decent yet inexpensive glove one can carry in a repair kit as a backup in case of a rip? \[links are much appreciated.\]
2. do you wear anything under your dry suit insulation? if so, what?
3. should hot caffeinated beverages like coffee or tea be avoided before a cold water dive?
4. what's your favorite local cold season, cold water diving destination? when is the last time you've been there?
5. for those with a p-valve, do you find you have a hard time getting it started underwater in temps below 10°c/50°f?
6. what's your recommendation for a hood for temperatures below 10°c/50°f? \[links are much appreciated.\]
7. what is your routine, if any, for initial acclimation to cold water below 5°c/41°f before a dive to mitigate the dreaded brain freeze?
8. do you have a harder time equalizing your ears in water temps below 5°c/41°f?
9. do you have a problem with tooth pain in water temps below 5°c/41°f?
10. do you subscribe to the belief of eating a high fat meal before cold water diving?

1,"your dive lights using ni-mh or li-ion batteries?searching through the various dive lights in the market, some use li-ion batteries, such as 18650, 26650, and a part of them use aa /aaa ni-mh batteries. from different users’ choice, there appears to be different opinions in regards to what the best battery is on a dive light. 

as we know, li-ion battery has good power, low self-discharge, no memory effect, and can be stored for years, wildly used in dive lights now. as for ni-mh battery, it has a good capacity, favorable price but relatively high self-discharge, with memory effect. many divers agree li-ion batteries have better performance on their dive lights. while, some prefer dive lights powered by ni-mh batteries. they say the specific energy capacity is greater with several 18650, 26650, but the whole dive light is also heavier, bigger, which might negatively affect diving. if they want 2 hours runtime, lighter nimh also has more than enough power capacity for that.

normally when a tank is tested, it gets stamped with the date of the test, usually month and year.

except this time, instead of being punched 01/21 as would be expected, the tester seems to have made a mistake (or time travelled) and punched it with 10/21 instead. so now i have a tank that will in theory be able to pass visual and could be filled by unknowing shops a solid ten months longer than it legally should be without having a test performed.

the tank integrity isn't really under any suspicion, its nearly brand new, with the number of fills it has taken being counted on fingers at this point. however i am unsure how any shops will approach the tank given it is stamped with a date that is still in the future.

anyone had something like this happen before? what did you do to get it rectified or sorted out?"

1,"diving in southern france/around setetl;dr: in search for dive spots in a radius of 2 car-hours around sete (france). any kind of recreational diving, max. depth 33m)


heyho guys,

i‘m currently planning the summer holidays (july) in the south of france and am looking for good dive spots and some general information. (given the pandemic allows it.)
we are planning 3-5 dive days with 1 or 2 dives each. (depending of the budged of my so, maybe even more.) 

can anyone give some advice on where to dive/rent tanks (air/nitrox) in a radius of 2 car-hours of sete? any kind of recreational diving with a max depth of 33m is okay.

also does anyone know what water temperatures to expect at depth in july?"
1,"what was your close call?the recent release and post about stratis kas' new book [close calls](https://stratiskas.com/closecalls/) made me think that it might be interesting, for those that are willing, to discuss our close calls and learn from each other both as instructors and as students. the purpose here is to open up the discussion about mistakes and accidents and how we can unfold the events to learn about the behavioral, environmental, and systemic actions that led to the situation. i think it's important to stress that it's easy to just say ""i never would have done x, y, or z"" out of the context of the situation and all that does is stonewall the conversation.

i'll start with my first incident - i don't know that this was a ""close call"" but it certainly was not a good situation to be in, especially as a new diver.

after my open water certification i got an internship at a local scuba shop and worked for gear and classes. in the span of a summer i went from open water all the way through rescue, which looking back was ridiculous and ultimately led to a separate incident because of this overconfidence that i gained due to my zero-to-hero recreational diving career. look up the dunning-kruger effect.

my first incident was during a ""deep"" dive for my advanced open water certification. it was myself, the instructor, and another student diving off a boat. the dive was simple enough, we were going to hit a tug boat at 80fsw, the instructor was going to run a reel, and we were going to follow. the instructor was diver 1, the other student diver 2, and i was last.

conditions weren't terrible for the northeast, but as a new diver they were a little daunting. it was cold and the visibility was probably about 10 feet. the instructor tied off their reel and we started making our way across the deck. pretty soon after, it felt like there was a strong current or resistance - and in the blink of an eye my instructor and dive buddy disappeared into the murk. i started kicking harder, thinking that it was current but i was going nowhere fast.

though a fairly inexperienced diver, i had the frame of mind to stop and grab onto the wreck (remember, i was thinking this is a current that was going to sweep me away). this at least gave me a moment to catch my breath and think about what was going on. i didn't really know what to think - i hadn't really prepared for a situation like this. i didn't have the equipment for my own free ascent.

thankfully, what felt like 3 days later, my buddy and instructor returned. i gave them the signal that something was wrong - my buddy swam up to me - and untangled the instructors line from around my tank and we completed an otherwise uneventful dive.

so, what happened?

i think there were a lot of factors that played into this situation, some of which could have been easily  avoided. firstly, the divers and the environment: it was cold and murky and we were new to diving and new to that environment. if there's one thing i would have changed, it would have been our positioning relative to each other - there was plenty of space to not require us to be in a single file line.  looking back, the conditions had me fixated on what was in front of me, my buddy, and assuring i didn't lose them - which certainly contributed to my proximity to and ultimately entanglement in the line. it may have been beneficial for the instructor, or at least where they ran their line, to be positioned somewhere else relative to us as well.

secondly, the dive briefing: i didn't know what dangers a reel posed and i certainly didn't consider the fact that it could get tangled around my tank. i believe the instructor could have briefed us about the use of a reel and how we should position ourselves relative to the line."

i weigh 220, wearing a hollis neotek semi dry, al80 tank, and an old backplate (plastic) and wing.

 i am currently using 26 pounds of weight on one of the old school belts.  i am not super happy with the belt set up, it works, but no matter how tight i make it, it’s always loose and spinning once i am in the water.

i dive in southern california so the thick wetsuit or semi dry is a must.  i know that means a lot of buoyancy.  as a new diver i know that i am potentially holding too much air in my lungs, but i typically have to dump my entire bc to even be able to get below the water.  once down below 20 feet i feel comfortable using my lungs to make adjustments while swimming over rocks and what not.

what set ups are you guys diving and how do you manage weight?"

&amp;#x200b;

all you cold water divers out there, diving under the ice is an overhead environment even if it only covers part of a water body. please, if there is any ice on your lake, quarry, etc ... treat a dive like an ice dive. if you are not trained to dive in overhead environments, don't do it.

there are **many** ways that a partially frozen water body can kill you. cave dives *sort of* sound scary and the dive community is pretty vocal about people without cave training staying out of caves. ice can be just as dangerous, treat it as such."

1,"honest review of the tecdivings ""divecomputer.eu"" dive computeralmost exactly two years ago i bought the ""[divecomputer.eu](https://divecomputer.eu)"" (sic) from [https://divecomputer.eu/](https://divecomputer.eu/)

it is made by polish manufacturer of diving equipment (lights and ccr-things) that decided to create a cheaper version of the shearwater petrel.

i was a very early adopter and probably the first one in sweden to own one, i bought it the day they opened up shipping to sweden. i bought mine for  €495 including shipping, it currently sells for €466 + shipping so significantly cheaper than a perdix.

i'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, and i'll tell you the story after 120-ish dives (both tec and rec)

**features**

* blue tooth (software update via bt)
* supported by libdivecomputer(subsurface)
* full zhlf16c with gf
* full trimix with  he/02 0-100%
* p02 setting
* aa battery powered, user replaceable
* internal compass
* several display modes (oc tec/rec), ccr, apnea, ""pure bühlmann""
* 10 different gasses
* possible to add/change gas under water

**missing features**

* air integration

my computer came with software version 3.0/hardware 1.0 (first version with wet contacts), (current latest is simply called nxp)

**story of an involuntary beta-tester**

initially, several of the stated features where missing, especially the subsurface support and  variable p02. apperantly, polish diver use max-po2 at 1.6 bar hardcoded.

the computer broke after only 4 dives, sent it back to manufacturer who found a defect pressure sensor, replaced it and sent it back. the process took a while but they had a support portal and could interact with them. once repaired it seemed to work fine and i updated it regularly with new patches from their supplied boot loader. it's will require some minor it-skills to get it up and running, but nothing major. the biggest change was when they released support for importing dives with libdivecomputer. again, some ""fiddling"" for it to work (had to manually create a com-port for paired device).

one annoyance was that the computer sometimes would suddenly reboot under water and loose all deco info. this is of course not acceptable and i made several inquires through supportportal with no/little response. i eventually found the issue (or so i think), a jolt/sudden movement could shake the aa-battery enough to loose contact with connectors. after cleaning the connectors, stretching the spring a bit and adding a layer of electrical tape to the battery the issue almost went away.

it would sometimes reboot in the surface after rolling of the side of the boat, i guess the ""jolt"" from that height was enough to upset something. but still, not acceptable.

i was about to just cut my loss and get a perdix, but thought that might give the latest version of hardware a change, so i sent it back to the manufacturer (hardware needs to be done by them obviously). unfortunately, corona struck and they pretty much closed shop, took me almost 4-5 months to get it back! (the upgrade was done free of charge, i only paid the shipping to them)

now it runs version 4.1 (i.e. not the very latest) but performance/stability is finally acceptable.i have had no issues with it so far (although just 40 dives in) but i still tape the batteries (old habit)

**so, how is it to use?**

the computer it self is roughly the size of an old petrel, it is a sturdy construction and haven't seem any issues with wear. the front buttons are easy to maneuver with but sometimes it's hard to press both with only one hand (when i have it mounted). this is only needed to turn on/off. all other operations are using only one button.

the one thing i do trust is the deco algorithm implementation, it matches 100% with friends shearwaters  and subsurface calculated deco. so, nothing to complain about here.

diving with it is easy, the screen has four brightness modes of which i only use ""cave"" which is plenty given the dark scandinavian waters. changing gas is dead simple, as is switching between screens.

battery life is about max 15 hours when diving in cold waters (&lt;10c). i tend to change after 13-14 hours of run time. (use standard non-rechargeable aa)

i've never befriended the electronic compass, it tends to ""flutter"" a bit to much and i find it very hard to use. i prefer an old school wrist mounted non-digital version.

it has wet contacts so it tends to go into dive mode by just being splashed, no depth needed. once in dive mode, most settings are locked. then you have to wait for it to ""dry"" enough to go out of dive mode before changing. it also stays in dive mode on the surface after a dive. (because it's wet), thus all dive logs has a tail of 10 min at zero depth. (fortunately subsurface cuts away this time)

i've given this feedback to manufacturer but no changes/response. (maybe fixed now, not sure)

otherwise, i'm fairly happy with it, now (given that the stability is maintained), the computer it self does it's job just fine with no/few bells and whistles.

&amp;#x200b;

**verdict:**

a fun experiment that now has resulted in a usable computer.  i'm not going to replace it if it behaves like it's doing now.

personally, if i should do it again, i would save up €400 more and get a perdix, mostly based on the manufacturers support capacity. they are a small time supplier trying hard, but nowhere near ""organized"" as big as the major brands.

if you have only exactly €466+shipping to spend on a full tec-computer or want to support some one else than shearwater, by all means! i would trust the latest version (nxp) , the performance/stability has increased with each release."

this is my first major gear purchase and a driving factor has been moving to mi and dealing with shit gear that i've rented. would be looking to pick up a new regulator and would love advice on that too. was planning to go look at the bcd and try it on to make sure it fits and the wing holds air. will look for any salt water damage but from the pictures it looks like its in decent shape. 

what do you think? thanks for reading my novel."

heyho guys, 

i know there is a baseline debate about if primary donate or even a longhose  is or isn’t something for recreational diving. this is not my question as i got trained in primary donate. therefor it’s my first instinct for ooa-scenarios and i will stick to it. 

my ”problem“ is that i currently own a full setup including a jacket style bcd with a wing bladder. while doing ooa-drills i‘ve noticed that my current hose length makes managing an ooa-situation difficult as i have to stay offset to my buddy to not yank the reg out of their mouth. now i‘m thinking about changing the setup to a longhose but all materials i found online only show it in combination with a harness and bp/wing. my question now is if anyone has experience with this mix of equipment or what you think about it. do i need to upgrade my bcd before changing hoses?

best withes and a happy new year!

i’m an aow and rescue cert based in ohio with about 60 logged dives in just under three years, primarily in the carribbean/florida although i’ve done some more challenging dives in the galapagos and mexican cenotes. 

i recently read the phenomenal book shadow divers and was inspired to pursue more challenging cold water/low vis wreck dives.

i’m very interested in the lake erie diving community and haven’t had a ton of luck finding answers to all my questions.  i plan on getting a dry suit certification this spring, and pursuing more cold water diving in general.

was looking for help answering the following questions about lake erie (or even ontario, trying to stay within 6 hours of cincinnati)

1. what is the typical diving season (warmest water)? 

2. is a wreck certification really necessary if i don’t plan on penetration, at least right away?

3. what is the typical cost of a dive charter?

4. is it common to find charters out of the cleveland/sandusky area? do trips book far in advance or is it something that can be done with short notice?

5. do conditions stay fairly stable during the ideal diving “season”, or is it more like sit around and wait for a good day?

6. are there a good amount of wrecks to keep me busy closer to the sandusky/cleveland areas?  i’d like to avoid temps under 45f or so and stay under 100 feet of depth until i get more experience.

after properly quarantining, we arrived on the island yesterday. today was our first day in the water and i completely failed. my dad told me after we left that he was warned by some people to have me do pool dives first, but the instructor told me that 10 year olds do better than i did all the time, and i can’t help but think i’m the issue. 

to explain what i felt when trying to dive, it felt like there was too much going on at once. i would be fine for a few breaths, but then begin to panic and feel like i couldn’t breathe. the waves were really intense and i just couldn’t multitask. 

do i have any hope of getting better in the future by training in a pool, or is this abnormal and pretty hopeless?"

i recently got my ow certification and i'm 9 dives in on a 10 day vacation in cozumel. its amazing, really having a great time but i'm trying to understand how to improve my skills as i'm really enjoying it so far and want to improve. i'm 6'1' 185 lbs and in decent physical shape.

my main issue is that i'm running out of air in 30-40 minutes when diving 30-70 feet. i ran out of air in 30 minutes last night on a night dive that was no deeper than 40 ft, everyone else hit 55+ minutes. on one of my dives yesterday, another person on the boat doing their open water certification (similar height/wt/gender) lasted a full 15 minutes longer than me under the water. i've literally been coming up, every single dive, essentially halfway through the dive. its really starting to frustrate me. diving with friends/girlfriend and missing half the experience just starts to get old i guess. 

i don't feel stressed or anxious, based on feedback from other divers my trim and buoyancy control are pretty good for my experience level. its frustrating that i can't find any answers other than ""dive more"" (based on research online as well as picking the divemasters brains). is there anything i can work on improving in the short term to increase my bottom time while i'm here."
1,"single tank wing and handheld light recommendations?hi everyone,

i'm looking for a couple of equipment opinions and/or recommendations.  

&amp;#x200b;

first: what's your favourite single-tank wing?  my set-up is as follows: i have a diverite stainless steel back plate, and i've redone a custom harness.  i have a diverite travel exp wing that needs to be replaced with something.  this is where i'm unsure of what's good these days.  the size was ok (but i could go bigger), but i found the stitching to be pretty weak on the rear dump and the low pressure inflator.  

&amp;#x200b;

my first wing lasted about 2.5 years of heavy usage (failed on the low pressure hose, one of my friends who was rough with his went through 2 or 3 in that time), my second lasted 4 years (heave usage then extended storage - lost it to dry rot), and this one is in its 3rd year of very moderate usage (no rot, well maintained, stitching is failing on the rear dump and low pressure).

&amp;#x200b;

the other thing: handheld dive lights, ideally aa or aaa batteries.  any opinions at all are welcome.  i suppose i would be in the 'medium' budget range, and could be in the market for two (not necessarily identical).  i've had a bunch of different lights which mostly just wore out eventually.  i remember one brand that seemed to tick the boxes, but corroded ridiculously quickly.  while i don't remember the name, i heard they had gone out of business.

***

hi, lady diver here. i am currently stuck using a bcd (jacket style*, weight integrated) that's not tailored for basic hips, narrow shoulders, and a lower center of gravity. i also wear 14-16 lbs on a belt but this has to be worn high around my waist because it's nylon webbing and my drysuit is neoprene. as such, it sits directly on top of my hips, sort of underneath the bcd cummerbund and weight pouches...and it hurts. it also sucks for trim. 

can you think of any major drawbacks from swapping this out for my rubber freediving belt and wearing it lower, around my hips? 

*please note that i would purchase a different bcd if i had the funds, so please don't let this turn into a bpw sales pitch.

i was at about 48-50ft deep (the deep point of this dive) and i felt a sudden very sharp pain in my left ear, i couldn't equalize at all. tilting my head to one side didn't help.  i wasn't too sure what to do, my dive buddy signaled that i should decend but i wasnt thinking clearly and i started to accend it didn't hurt more. i finally had it clear about 3-4 hours after that dive. it was also the last dive of the day we had previously done 2 deep dives that day, 1 to 120ft and 1 to 83ft."

1,"is your direction estimation from hearing off in water?so i was recently thinking about how we can estimate where a sound source (on land) is based on the time delay between left and right ear (and probably other factors based on sound attenuation through ear cartilage and so on).

however, the speed of sound in water is 4x faster than in air (on land). so, the time delay at any given angle (relative to your head) is much smaller than for the same angle on land. so supposedly, i felt like this woild screw with your ability to estimate the direction of a sound source. specifically, everything sounds like it's coming more in front/behind you than it actually is.

does anyone notice this? if not, guesses on why not?"

while “normal” diving would not be a concern to me, it looks like by the very nature of the efr and rd courses as far as i’ve seen (exercises above the water surface, cpr, maybe others), it does not seem like it lends itself very well to measures like distancing or blocking respiratory droplets. 

im wondering if someone with experience in efr and rd courses before or, better, during the pandemic would be willing to comment on how realistic is to stay safe in these courses?

1,"macro and wide angle with the olympus e-pl9 without changing lensesi'm thinking about upgrading my underwater camera from a gopro 7. as an obvious next step i'm looking at the olympus tg6. since i don't want to buy every ""step"" in the ladder of underwater cameras, i'm also looking at slightly higher-end but still affordable models, namely mirrorless cameras. recently i came across the [backscatter review of the e-pl9/10](https://www.backscatter.com/reviews/post/olympus-e-pl10-underwater-camera-housing-review), that called it the ""best bang for your buck"" in underwater cameras, so obviously i'm intrigued.

what really appeals to me about the tg6 is that it is capable of taking macro shots as well as wider scenes without the need for a dedicated (wet) lens that needs to be changed. that means that the camera in its underwater housing without any additional lens is a very versatile camera for the amount of gear you're taking on your dive.

so my question is this:  
is it possible to equip the e-pl9 with a lens that would allow me to take macro shots as well as wider shots (e.g. of larger fish or a wreck) simply by changing the zoom etc of the camera? are there other ""better"" (i.e. with larger sensors) cameras than the tg6 that can do this?

thanks for your advice!"

then i realized i have two really nice wet suits (a shorty and a full sized) in my closet that haven’t been touched for like 8 years, when i got fat and couldn’t fit them anymore. i just tried both of them on, and they fit **perfectly**. it feels like christmas came a few days early for me! 

anyway, that was one really unexpected benefit i’ve received from losing all of this fat… now i just need to figure out how much less weight i’m going to need per dive compared to what i’ve been using!"

1,"my first diving class experiencei've completed my open water course a week ago and want to share my experience with you. it was amazing! the best week of my vacation. was it hard? undoubtedly. it was demanding but fascinating work.

first day. we began with theory lessons and equipment configuration.  i asked other people about my instructor. it was interesting. many people said to me before, it's impossible to fail an open water class. that's not the case. it's definitely possible with him. i had begun to worry about it a bit.

second day. the first practice session. i sucked at everything! i nearly drowned myself while trying to put my fins on. i used fins for the first time, and it was a disaster. i felt like it's almost impossible to swim with them! my attempts had no success. i was swimming to the side, or worse - nowhere. moreover, it was hard to maintain my position underwater. i was constantly rolling belly up. i tried to clear the mask. again, no success there. i couldn't breathe with water touching my nose! it was upsetting and surprising. i used to swim underwater in a pool without any issues, but this was different. i spent a lot of time trying to learn to breathe correctly. i drank all the seawater. swimming is another thing. we had to go snorkeling to learn how to use fins. 

third day. after the second day, i was thinking about quitting. i was complete shit, was unable to do anything right. i decided to give myself one more chance. this day went a lot better. i finally learned how to swim with fins. it was quite successful. the funny note, i find frog kick easier than flutter. people say it's normally opposite. mask clearing was a problem. sometimes i did it, sometimes i drank water. my achievements by that day - dropping to the seabed, and accidental surfacing. i knew how it works, but actually doing it is a different thing. buoyancy control is a hard skill. 

fourth day. i did it! mask clearing is not an issue anymore. it was not easy but i did it. people asked me what did i see underwater. i didn't know. i did see my bottom timer and compass, i did see my instructor. i didn't pay attention to other things, haha. i became better at buoyancy control. ascents were black magic (i was about to lose control several times) but swimming at the level was quite successful.

fifth day. do you like math? i felt sorry for my laziness. i spent previous three days rereading my books because i didn't pay attention to formulas and equations when i read them the first time before the beginning of my class. i broke my mind with all that math stuff. scr, rmv, mod, ead, etc etc. it's easy to understand but you have to have practice in calculations to avoid stupid mistakes. the practice sessions went well. no more eating the sand. i was able to descend more precisely. i did a swim without a mask - i couldn't imagine doing this two days ago!

sixth day. ascending is hard! i was asked about my pressure on the ascend. while i was checking my spg, i accidentally ascended by 1.5 meters above others and had to drop my spg dangling and fix my buoyancy immediately. successfully, but it sucks anyway. i saw more videos of me. haha, i was better. no more swimming with arms. 

seventh day. we did two last dives. no more black magic - i ascended without issues. i finally understood how it works. he asked me what did i think about my performance. i remembered my awkward finning, instant dropping to the bottom when i was simulating an out of gas situation, almost getting tangled while trying to put on my gear in water, all those funny videos. i really didn't know. 

the good news, i was good enough. i successfully finished the course. there's a lot of things i want to improve though.

what could i advise to other people who are thinking about learning to dive? don't give up! there is nothing you can't do. you can see pictures and videos of me in my previous posts.

p.s. english is hard. i'm pretty sure i've written it understandable though."

i am currently considering between a 3mm non hooded vest (found one by bare) and lavacore/sharkskin/bare exowear vest.

1,"adjustable focus torches - what do you use the wider modes for?hi brains trust!  
i've hit decision paralysis over torches - i was considering a couple of the adjustable focus ones (mix of day and night diving, but mostly for night), but from reading, seems like people tend to use spot lights for night diving.  
so, those who like adjustable focus torches - what do you use the wider angles for?  and do they work with mid-ranges or do you tend to be all-out or all-in?

also, for torches going up to 800, 1000 or more lm....what do you use the brighter settings for?  murky water mostly?"

1,"dive master for fun?hi all. i am an office worker and would probably never leave my day job. however, like most of us here i bloody love diving. i am padi aow and have about 65 dives under my belt, my pride and joy is my backplate and wing, and i love the technical aspects (getting buoyancy right etc) as much as what i can see. 

i also like helping other people. today two freshly qualified ow divers were struggling (to get down) and the dive instructor was barely interested. i helped them get down, discussed weight with them etc. they had a great dive and i got a buzz out of helping make that happen.

my question is... should i do a dm course just for fun? it is pointless if i have no interest in actually diving professionally (though i'd be interested in doing it as a side hussle possibly). 

if not, what about rescue diver?

cheers."

i am teaching the course social psychology of risk offered by charles sturt university (australia) as part of the degree bachelor of outdoor recreation.

while research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how participants perceive the associated risks in others activities/sports and, more generally, how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. to this end i have designed a survey and i would like yo enlist your kind help.

the survey data will be used by students to design adventure outdoor recreation programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and i will to use the data to write several research overviews.  the background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/risk/riskproject.html)

if you are over 18 yrs of age, would you mind participating by filling out the survey, please?

the survey can be found at this link:

[https://www.research.net/r/advoutrecos\_out](https://www.research.net/r/advoutrecos_out)

the survey should take about 20-25 min to complete. 

**mobile device users** please be aware that surveymonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll right or down as well to see everything. i apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

i am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but i can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

all that being said my 3 year old columbia newton ridge plus have started to show their age and some of the tread is coming off now. i’ve also noticed that my feet and legs hurt after really long hikes (we did about 8-10 miles in on day trip in the porkies with more elevation than i’m used to). someone suggested resoleing them, but i’m thinking getting the shoes a pair of new laces and then giving them to my local salvation army so someone else can use them for hiking. 

all that being said i’m pretty uncertain on what to get next as an “upgrade” for my serious and longer hikes in the future.

here’s the boots i’m going between:

- salomon x ultra mid 3 gtx 

- oboz bridger mid bdry

- hoka one one kaha gore-tex 

i should mention that i’m roughly 138lbs, 5’3” and a women. so recommendations based these factors would be nice (:"

0,"what is the best way to build up my endurance and stamina?a friend and i just recently moved to colorado and are really excited to start hiking regularly and see what the beautiful state has to offer.  however, we are admittedly inexperienced.  

just this past weekend we went on a 3 mile loop trail with about a 580ft elevation change.  it was a bit of a struggle for us on some of the inclines.  all in all the trail took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes - 2 hours (we were taking quite a bit of photos at the start and then realized it was getting dark, so we packed the cameras and picked up the pace).  the week before we did a 1.8 mile hike that felt a lot quicker and easier.

i guess my main question, is what is the best way and frequency to build up our endurance so we can take on longer and more challenging trails.  i definitely don't want to just dive in on a 10 mile trail that i'm not prepared for, but i'd like to build to that and would appreciate suggestions on how i can do so efficiently without burning myself out too quickly."

so, my question is, can anyone recommend a tube i can use as a replacement that won't make my drink taste like plastic? preferably something i can just swap the tube out for so i can keep using the valve and quick disconnect i have, but if that's not an option i'm open to getting another brand of reservoir and matching tube.

i have a little bit of experience doing 15+ mile single day hikes with tons of switchbacks in the mountains in new mexico and wyoming, but i've only ever hiked with my dad. i've never had to navigate and such myself. a trail that is hard to get lost on would be most ideal, because i don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to navigate. i'm going with a friend, and she's a complete beginner with hiking. we're both very fit female athletes. 

does anyone have any suggestions for which trails we should do that fit the above criteria? we're looking to see some beautiful scenery. we want to be tired and worn out after the hikes, but we also don't want to exceed our beginner capabilities. we want to stay safe and have a fun time out there hiking. 

not sure if i worded everything in this question correctly, as i said i'm very new to setting all this up myself without my father to guide me. any help would be greatly appreciated!!"

well anyways! the reason i’m sharing this is because i’d really appreciate if you guys could share with me some cool places, sights, forrest, local legends and well kept secrets. it doesn’t have to be glamorous, it can be just a local cool spot. i promise to be respectful and i will keep the location discreet if you wish. places that requires hiking/ camping would be extra cool! also the more difficult to get to the better!

only thing is i can’t find one that has either an acceptable amount of storage for hiking necessities (food, water, emergency kit, etc; i usually go on 6+ hours hikes) as a backpack, or i can’t find a sling/harness with a clip type system that’s secure enough for scrambles and strenuous terrain so i can carry a regular backpack. does anyone have any suggestions or ideas of where i can look to find one? i really don’t want to have to start leaving her behind and missing out on all the great things she could sniff"

if you’re early into dating this person, you may not be showing a great deal of physical touch. hiking gives the opportunity for physical contact.

be chivalrous if you’re a man. give a hand climbing over a log or crossing a stream. either of you may touch an arm or shoulder when pointing out wildlife along the trail.

be romantic and thoughtful along the way. consider a picnic in the valley below a majestic mountain, by a lake, a peaceful stream, or waterfall along the trail. whether you stop for a picnic or not, the beauty of nature that you encounter can spur romance. stop and enjoy the sights along the way. create memories."
0,"how often do you actually take the ten essentials on a hike?i’m pretty bad for not taking the ten essentials when i go hiking.  a headlamp, sure, a little first aid kit, yup, a shelter and extra layers, rarely.

from what i’ve read, if you’re hiking longer than half an hour, you’re supposed to take the ten essentials with you.  most of the hikes i do are under 5 km, so i feel like it’s not necessary to take the ten essentials because i’m always no more than 2.5 km away from my car, even if the hike itself is more than half an hour long.

thinking about my own lack of the ten essentials has me wondering about other people’s threshold for taking them vs not taking them.

when do you take them?  (judged by distance, time, popularity of the trail?)

when do you leave them behind?  (do you always take them regardless?)

0,where is a good place near nj for a 2-4 week hike ?ive never been hiking in my life and i plan on quitting my job some time this year and just going off the grid for a bit. i dont want to go to far from nj just incase of family emergencies. is there any trails that lead back to the beginning. sorry if this is a dumb question. i have no experience about any of this. what supplies should i buy that i would not think of myself? and like when you go to sleep do you sleep near the trail ? how far off do you go to set up a sleeping site?

0,"solo backpacking at mammoth cave // 35 mile loop around kentucky’s national parkhello everyone! hope you are doing well, and staying safe with all the flooding recently. just wanted to share another backpacking trip i got the chance to do back on nov 18-19, 2020. i got the opportunity to travel back down close to where i grew up to do a 35mile overnight backpacking trip at kentucky’s lone designated national park, mammoth cave. it was a beautiful two days filled with warm sunshine, lots of water, rock features, cave outcroppings, wildlife, and diverse terrain. it felt good exploring in a place so close to home.

0,"hiking like a russianhi folks.

there's a certain type of hiking here in russia, literally called ""sport tourism"". some dudes gather and hike routs that's prepared in advanced and defense it in special organization. routs include distance no less than 110 km and special obstacles such as rivers, marshes, mountain passes (nek?) etc. (depends on type of tourism: hiking mostly flat terrain or mountain, by foot, bicycle, car, ski).  they have big backpacks often special mountaineering gears. it's hard, tough and it hurts.

so is there in any other place such an activity?"

my wife and i are wanting to travel out west to utah and arizona to do some hiking. we are active/in good health but with beginner to intermediate hiker experience. we have done some more “challenging” hikes that required climbing in previous hikes (nothing requiring gear/support) and can hike up to 12-15 miles rt.

we plan to go out april 10-18. i know some areas will be closed but we are looking for recommendations to maximize our time. i don’t envision us camping out (we like nature but not that much; our backs like a nice bed). in addition to hiking, we like to explore nearby towns when vacationing to check out local eats and drinks (of all kinds). it’ll be april, but we have enjoyed paddle boarding and would probably enjoy low stakes water activities like kayaking or canoeing on easy waters.

with that being said

looking for recommendations for the following: 

1. best place to fly into (seems las vegas has been what a lot of people do and make a loop)

2. what places to see and how much time to spend there to maximize our time and places we could skip out on. 
    - places that we definitely want to make our way to: zion park, bryce canyon, arches. grand canyon, lake powell and escalante.

thanks in advance for any tips and advice!"

i would say i’m a very experienced hiker however i have never done anything like the narrows, i.e. wading through a river for multiple miles. i have proper hiking boots but i will be doing multiple trails in multiple parks during my 2 week trip and am looking to avoid blisters. would y’all recommend that i wear old tennis shoes rather that hiking boots? or should i rent gear from the park (i have heard that is a thing, hoping to confirm)? the trail looks awesome and i’m not worried about the physical aspect of it, it is just something i have never done and i don’t want poor judgement on how to avoid blisters to ruin the rest of my trip. any gear recommendations or any information in general would be greatly appreciated. thank you so much!

after about 1 year, the vibram sole chunked on one of the boots. i left it alone  and now i need to deal with it since it is clear it won't make the 2 year end date. they can be resoled for $100, but if i spend that much the money will be going to a new pair of boots instead.

i have no experience with this but the patch adhesive needs to stick both to leather and rubber, but i'm not sure what products to use. i've been using duct tape so the tape wears instead of the leather. i looked at the auto parts store for adhesive and jbweld had some rubber welding product i considered using. not sure if that will work?

in july i'm off to a hiking experience that will last 5 long and sunny days. the route is in most parts very difficult (i will insert a picture below in the comments about what i mean and the ratings).

i desire to be able to hike it through and want to have my physical and mental preparations.

do you have any propositions on where to begin?

i was thinking of: running for 30 mins a day (after a few weeks i will build it up and start running uphill), standing on a tennis ball to build balance in my ankles, planks, crunches, squats, and lunges, work on some more cardio (not certain what i would do) and i'll be doing step-ups with my backpack weighted.

if you have any opinions on how much of that i should be doing, please feel free to mentor me.

thank you!"

one of our biggest focuses now is trying to make sure we have the right clothing for the weather. i've seen everything from average highs for the week of our trip being in the 80s, all the way down to the 40s. definitely planning to layer, layer, layer - but i'd love to hear from residents or from people who live in the area: what should we expect weather-wise? our tentative plan is leggings with t-shirts with a lightweight jacket in our backpack...although if temperatures tend to err closer to the 80s-side, i'd be dying in leggings haha and would prefer shorts. 

also just curious what desert-specific gear we may be overlooking. we have the basics from our hikes out in this area...but is there anything standing out in your head like ""oh yeah, you need x, y and z""?

in the last few years i've really gotten into hiking in the pnw.

i hike in the cascades for high lake fishing and light backpacking, and the east side of wa (rocky desert).

i'm not opposed to buying multiple pairs of boots for multiple uses, but i'm an immature spiteful sob and i hate having to replace boots mid season and will avoid a brand that disappointed me in the slightest 

i've had great luck with my vasques (2 years out of each pair), but i'm hoping for some light/ultralight references that will last more than (or at least) a year.

any and all recommendations welcome! although i'll say i didn't care for the columbias i tried a couple years ago... a midsize boot.

i had an idea for a hiking trip, which i think would be doable, although it would be pretty exhausting. i am and always have been a fairly solid hiker, we often hiked through the alps like 30 km a day without being that exhausted, now that is with all the steepnes of the mountains. about 4 years ago, i limited the amount of hiking i was doing because i had more things to do, but i always felt wrong about it and now i'm back on track, i've exercised a lot and i have this idea brewing in my mind.

i want to go from prague to the upper austrian prealps, and i figured that with 50 km a day, which i know is doable, it could be done in 8 - 10 days (it's about 400km). however, i've never been on such a track before, so i don't know what the strain on the human body is if you continue to go this distance for this long and i figured i'd ask here, what do you guys think?

tl;dr: is it possible to walk 400 km in 8-10 days?"

just this weekend i went to rei, tried on a bunch of boots and liked the salomon quest 4d 3 gtx.  bought them, and then went on a hike yesterday.  we were planning to do 7 miles, but i had to tap out after only 3.5 (thankfully the loop passed my car) because not only was i developing blisters on my heels, but the arches on the insides of my feet were absolutely killing me.  i dont think i tied the boots all that well, they lace a bit different than im used to.

that being said, my feel, while still sore this morning, felt mostly better so i made sure to lace up properly, took a walk around my neighborhood where we have some big hills, and my arches were killing me again.  heels felt better, but arches really sore, to the point they hurt right now as i type this at my standing desk.

is this a part of breaking in, or should i return these and get something else?

0,"floridian day hiker considers water bottles vs hydration bladdershi everyone, i'm here asking what i imagine is a common question. i've seen *some* discussion about it on this sub, but the most recent thread is quite old...wanted to get some fresh takes:

water bottles vs hydration bladders

some buddies and i are going to start day hiking in florida. these will be flat terrain trips, the most common hurdles will be exposed roots, mud, puddles, etc. i don't have a proper hiking/outdoor pack and i'm considering a few options from osprey... i really love their warranty. the heaviest gear i plan to carry will be water. my biggest desire with a pack is functional storage - even if its limited. a spot to put my keys, a shove it pouch, an internal mesh pocket to hold some cards, some cash, etc. a lot of the packs i'm looking at (the skarab 18 and 22, for example) don't have this storage functionality. as such, i've moved up to looking at the skarab 30 (has a front shove it pocket and a small mesh pocket inside) and the widely adored talon 22. i don't think i *\*need\** a pack quite that large, but it could be something i grow into for more extensive hikes. 

the skarab 30 includes one of ospreys hydration bladders in the deal and the external pockets, from what i've read, are only *just ok* at storing water bottles. the skarab 30 is right around $130 usd right now. the talon 22 *does* have a sleeve for the hydration bladder, but it's not included. at $130 as well, i'd prefer to avoid adding the bladder if possible - $130 is already over my original intended budget of $100. if i go with the talon, i was thinking of getting two 1l nalgene bottles - or just bottles that i have on hand.

the choice i make will set me off on very different paths regarding hydration and, considering the up front investment, will be a choice i'll live with for some time. so i wonder... considering i *don't* own either of them currently... what should i consider when deciding between being a ""water bottle guy"" or a ""hydration bladder guy.""

bottles seem to have lots of practical advantages - easy to clean, would stand up better to things like sport drinks than the bladder, could be used in other applications (going to the beach, etc), and so on. the downside, as i see it currently, is the lack of convenience. would i find i have to stop and take off the pack in order to drink? if so, will i end up drinking less than i should? the advantage of the hydration pack, on the other hand, is exactly that - the convenience on the hike. but... i worry that i won't be motivated to clean it properly enough, so would i eventually ""forget"" to clean it and have to replace it? 

i'm wondering if there's anyone here that recently debated the two options themselves and what they considered and what they eventually decided. i'd also be open to different pack suggestions/setups, based on your experiences. 

thanks for your time!"

- while i’d like to say we’ll be backpacking soon, we are still very much car camping and probably will be for awhile.

initially it looked like a 24 l bag would be the right size. but with the kid’s stuff too, maybe i need a bigger size? i also would love a real hip belt and some of the smaller budget friendly packs don’t have those. 

would my stuff drown in the rei women’s 40 daypack? osprey had a nice 24 l, too.

any thoughts?? thanks i’m advance!


* i know the kids are technically big enough for their own packs, but we’re not quite there yet."
0,airport question involving hikingplanning a trip out west to utah in early april and being from delaware it’s not sensible to drive so my question is what foods am i able to bring through the airport in either carry on or luggage ? am i restricted to just the “add hot water and shake” bagged meals ? (which i’m trying to avoid due to how expensive they are)

0,"advice on first time back packing?hey not sure if this is allowed on this subreddit, but i didn't see any rules against it. i am planning on doing my first backpacking trip with a group of friends but none of us have gone backpacking before.  i have camped before, but i've never camped anywhere that was not a campground. we're planning on hiking probably somewhere in california, but have no concrete plans on when/where yet. i wanted to know if there's any advice you have for first time backpacking or good resources on where to learn. recommendations on picking out trails or locations would be great too!"
